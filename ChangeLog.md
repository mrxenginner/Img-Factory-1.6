## May 2026 — Model Workshop bleed-through CONFIRMED FIXED

The bleed-through in Model Workshop when docked inside IMG Factory is now
confirmed fixed. Took multiple sessions to track down. Full root cause
documented in v58 entry below. Tested across theme switches - no bleed.

## May 2026 — DFF frame names, vehicle structure analysis

**DFF frame name plugin fixed (`dff_parser.py` v5):**
- Extension 0x0253F2FE was treated as HAnim PLG header (skip). In VC vehicle
  DFFs, this extension IS the frame name string directly.
- Frame names now read correctly: chassis_hi, door_lf_hi_ok, bonnet_hi_ok,
  wheel_rf, wing_rf_hi_dam etc. Essential for vehicle part identification.
- All 46 frames of admiral.dff now named correctly.

**Vehicle editor planned (`TODO.md` v7):**
- 107 VC vehicles parse and frame-name correctly.
- Plan: render all atomics composited, handling.cfg editor, ped editor.
- Radar Workshop as base for handling editor layout.

## May 2026 — DFF parser: RW 3.3 has_pos fix (vehicles/peds)

**DFF parser: vehicles and peds now render (`dff_parser.py` v4):**
- `_parse_geometry`: in RW 3.3 (GTA VC, cv=0x0c02ffff) the morph target
  `has_pos` flag is stored as 0 even when vertices ARE present. All vehicle
  and ped DFFs were returning 0 vertices because the `if has_pos` check
  skipped the vertex data.
- Fix: when `has_pos=0` but `vert_count>0` and remaining struct bytes can
  hold `vert_count*12` bytes, force `has_pos=1` and read vertices.
- Confirmed: train.dff geom[0] now 2163v/1480t (was 0v), geom[1] 254v/146t.

**Texture thumbnail crash fixed (`model_workshop.py` v115):**
- `_populate_tex_thumbnails`: called `self._get_ui_color()` which only exists
  on `COL3DViewport`, not `ModelWorkshop`. Replaced with `QColor(40,40,40)`.

## May 2026 — DFF parser: RW 3.3 older format support

**DFF parser handles older VC/GTA3 format (`dff_parser.py` v3):**
- `_parse_geometry`: older VC DFFs (vehicles, peds) encode geometry flags in
  the struct chunk TYPE (e.g. 0x00010074) rather than using type=0x00000001.
  Parser was returning None for these, giving 0 vertices despite having triangles.
- `_parse_geometry_v33 #vers 1`: new method handles the older format:
  - Struct chunk body contains: numMorphTargets(4) + bsphere(16) + optional UVs
  - Vertex data lives AFTER the struct chunk in raw geometry chunk body
  - Triangle indices come from BinMesh extension (0x050e) not the struct
  - Builds triangles from BinMesh index list (triangle list or strip)
- `_parse_extension_v33 #vers 1`: parses BinMesh plugin for older geometry.
- Confirmed: TRAM.dff (standard) unaffected, train_dl.dff (older) now parses
  correctly (126v 96t vs previous 0v 96t).

## May 2026 — Texture thumbnails in list, TXD parser DXT fix

**Texture list now shows thumbnails (`model_workshop.py` v114):**
- `_populate_texture_list #vers 2`: was reading `pixel_data`/`compressed_data`
  (wrong keys). Now reads `rgba_data` from the parser dict.
- Column 0 is now a 48×48 thumbnail; col 1=Name, col 2=Size, col 3=Format.
- Row height set to 52px. Name tooltip shows #N, dimensions, format, mips.

**TXD parser DXT detection fixed (`txd_parser.py` v5):**
- `_parse_native_texture`: DXT size check now runs FIRST before raster_format
  interpretation. VC stores DXT data but marks raster_format as ARGB1555 —
  mip_size matching dxt1/dxt5 block size is the reliable discriminator.
- PAL8 (256-colour palette) support added.
- Debug output disabled (was left on for diagnosis).

## May 2026 — Model Workshop DFF toolbar buttons implemented

**DFF toolbar buttons implemented (`model_workshop.py` v112):**
- `_enable_dff_toolbar #vers 3`: buttons no longer hidden in DFF mode.
  `create_surface_btn` is COL-only (hidden). All others now active in both modes.
- `_wire_dff_buttons #vers 1` / `_wire_col_buttons #vers 1`: disconnect/reconnect
  shared buttons to mode-appropriate handlers on mode switch.
- `_dff_flip_y #vers 1`: negate Y coord on all geometry vertices.
- `_dff_flip_x #vers 1`: negate X coord on all geometry vertices.
- `_dff_rotate_cw #vers 1`: rotate 90° CW around Z axis (x,y)→(y,-x).
- `_dff_rotate_ccw #vers 1`: rotate 90° CCW around Z axis (x,y)→(-y,x).
- `_dff_analyze #vers 1`: dialog showing geometries, frames, atomics, verts, tris, mats per geometry.
- `_dff_copy_geometry #vers 1`: deepcopy selected geometry to `_dff_clipboard_geom`.
- `_dff_paste_geometry #vers 1`: append clipboard geometry to model, refresh list.
- `_dff_delete_geometry #vers 1`: confirm then delete selected geometry.
- `_dff_duplicate_geometry #vers 1`: deepcopy selected geometry, insert after it.

## May 2026 — Model Workshop bleed CONFIRMED FIXED

Bleed-through when docked in IMG Factory confirmed resolved after multiple
sessions. All three root causes fixed (see v58 entry). Tested across themes.

## May 2026 — Model Workshop bleed root cause found and fixed

**Bleed root cause (`model_workshop.py` v111):**
Three issues, all absent from COL/TXD, all contributing to bleed:

1. `_apply_theme #vers 8`: was calling `apply_panel_effects(self, app_settings)`
   which walks all child QFrame/QGroupBox and installs custom paintEvent hooks
   using `panel_fill_a`/`panel_fill_b` colours. These painted over widget
   backgrounds with wrong colours, and generated QPainter engine==0 spam on
   docked widgets. COL/TXD do not call this. Removed.

2. `_apply_theme`: was setting `self.setStyleSheet(ss)` (widget-level override)
   instead of `QApplication.setStyleSheet(ss)` + `self.setStyleSheet("")`.
   Widget-level override creates CSS specificity conflicts. Fixed to match
   COL/TXD exactly.

3. `open_model_workshop`: `container.setAutoFillBackground(True)` set on tab
   container. COL/TXD do not set this. Removed.

## May 2026 — TXD parser VC/III fix, no fallback

**TXD parser fixed for VC/III format (`txd_parser.py` v2):**
- `_parse_native_texture`: The 4 bytes after raster_format are `d3d_format`
  (FourCC) in SA but `has_alpha` (0 or 1) in VC/III. Parser was treating all
  games as SA so DXT FourCC never matched, rgba stayed None, texture dropped.
- VC/III fix: when field is not a known FourCC, reads mip data using the
  4-byte size prefix that precedes each mip level in VC/III format.
  Detects DXT1/DXT5 from mip data size signature; handles RGBA32/RGB24/RGB565.
- `_parse_txd_lightweight #vers 4`: fallback chunk-walker removed per no-fallback
  rule. Parser either works or returns empty.

## May 2026 — Search bar in model left panel, TXD parser fallback

**Search added to Model Workshop left panel (`model_workshop.py` v109):**
- `_create_left_panel #vers 6`: search button + hidden `QLineEdit` added
  matching COL Workshop pattern.
- `_show_model_search #vers 1`: toggles search box, clears on hide.
- `_filter_model_list #vers 1`: hides non-matching items live as user types.

**TXD parser fallback (`model_workshop.py` v109):**
- `_parse_txd_lightweight #vers 3`: if primary `txd_parser.py` returns empty,
  falls back to raw RW chunk walk extracting texture names from string chunks.
  Handles VC/III TXD variants that the primary parser misses.

## May 2026 — Temp file suffix + docked bleed (panel palette)

**Temp file random suffix fixed (2 more paths, `model_workshop.py` v108):**
- `_load_txd_file_from_data #vers 1`: `NamedTemporaryFile(prefix=name_, suffix=.txd)`
  was generating `tree3prc_m7lvjvto.txd`. Now uses `mkdtemp()` + real name.
- `_on_col_selected #vers 2`: same fix for DFF extraction from left panel.

**Docked bleed - panel background (`model_workshop.py` v108):**
- `_apply_theme #vers 7`: when docked, now walks `_main_splitter` children
  and sets `autoFillBackground` + Window palette colour on each panel.
  `WA_StyledBackground` set on self. Left and middle panels no longer
  transparent to imgfactory theme.

## May 2026 — Right-click model workshop, temp file name fix

**Right-click "Open in Model Workshop" enabled (`right_click_actions.py`):**
- Action was wired but `setEnabled(False)` — now enabled and connected.
- Duplicate `except` block removed from `open_dff_in_model_workshop`.

**Temp file random suffix fixed (`gui_layout.py` v34, `right_click_actions.py`,
`model_workshop.py` v107):**
- `NamedTemporaryFile(prefix=stem_, suffix=.dff)` generated names like
  `Air_brway_33_8ypw3fhr.dff` and `4culbulls_x6fvrfic.txd`.
  Now uses `tempfile.mkdtemp()` + `os.path.join(dir, entry.name)` so
  the file keeps its original name. `original_dff_name` passed through
  to `open_model_workshop` for IDE lookups.

## May 2026 — All Mdl_Editor references purged

**All `Mdl_Editor` references replaced (`dat_browser.py`, `imgfactory.py`,
`right_click_actions.py`, `gui_context.py`, `gui_menu.py`):**
- 9 occurrences of `apps.components.Mdl_Editor.mdl_workshop` replaced with
  `apps.components.Model_Editor.model_workshop`. `MDLWorkshop as ModelWorkshop`
  aliases removed. No more broken imports from any entry point.

## May 2026 — Compact restore on splitter move, DFF tab switch

**Compact buttons restore on splitter move (`model_workshop.py` v106, `col_workshop.py`):**
- `_on_splitter_moved #vers 2` (both): was only updating text panel visibility.
  Now also calls `apply_compact_buttons` with panel width — buttons restore
  to full text when panel is widened via splitter drag.

**DFF tab not switching on open fixed (`imgfactory.py`):**
- `_on_tab_changed #vers 10`: was importing `Mdl_Editor.mdl_workshop.MDLWorkshop`
  (deleted path) — `findChildren` found nothing, so taskbar sync and tab focus
  never fired. Fixed to `Model_Editor.model_workshop.ModelWorkshop`.
- Two other `Mdl_Editor` references in imgfactory.py also fixed.

## May 2026 — Compact button fix (model + col)

**Compact buttons now use panel width (`model_workshop.py` v105, `col_workshop.py`):**
- `resizeEvent #vers 5` (col), `resizeEvent` (model): was passing `self.width()`
  (full window ~1000px) to `apply_compact_buttons` — threshold never triggered.
  Now uses `_middle_btn_row.width()` so icon-only mode activates when the
  middle panel is actually narrow. Threshold lowered to 320px.
- TXD workshop not affected (different toolbar pattern).

## May 2026 — Model Workshop docked bleed root fix

**Docked bleed root cause fixed (`model_workshop.py` v104):**
- `_apply_theme #vers 6`: when docked, `self.setStyleSheet("")` was clearing
  widget stylesheet so imgfactory dark-red theme bled through. Now sets
  `self.setStyleSheet(ss)` on self when docked; standalone still sets QApplication.

**`_apply_theme` missing in gui_layout_custom (`gui_layout_custom.py` v15):**
- Added `_apply_theme #vers 1` — `_initialize_features` called it but it did
  not exist, causing AttributeError on every startup.

**Imgfactory `launch_model_workshop.py` v2:**
- Fixed `col_workshop.main()` typo — should be `model_workshop.main()`.

## May 2026 — QPainter engine==0 spam fixed, standalone launcher

**QPainter engine==0 fixed (`model_workshop.py` v103):**
- `COL3DViewport.paintEvent #vers 2`: added `isVisible`/size guard, `p.isActive()`
  check, and `p.end()` at all exit points. Painter was firing before widget
  was realized in embedded mode causing the spam.
- `ModelWorkshop.paintEvent #vers 3`: added `standalone_mode` guard and
  `painter.isActive()` check. Corner resize triangles only needed standalone.

**Model-Workshop standalone launcher fixed (`launch_model_workshop.py` v2):**
- Was importing `Mdl_Editor.mdl_workshop.MDLWorkshop` — path and class both wrong.
  Fixed to `Mdl_Editor.model_workshop.ModelWorkshop`.

## May 2026 — Model Workshop embedded launch rewritten

**Model Workshop embedded launch matched to TXD pattern (`model_workshop.py` v102):**
- `open_model_workshop #vers 5`: three fixes vs TXD:
  1. `container.setAutoFillBackground(True)` — tab container now paints background.
  2. `ModelWorkshop(container, main_window)` — positional args, container is Qt parent.
  3. `workshop.show()` added after tab insertion — was never called in embedded mode.
  Also adds DFF icon to tab label.

## May 2026 — Model Workshop docked bleed fixed

**Model Workshop bleed root cause (`model_workshop.py` v101):**
- `open_model_workshop #vers 4`: missing `workshop.setWindowFlags(Qt.WindowType.Widget)`
  after docked creation. TXD and COL both set this — it explicitly clears
  `FramelessWindowHint` set in `__init__`, which is why they showed fine and
  model_workshop bled on every theme.

## May 2026 — DAT Browser bleed CONFIRMED FIXED

**DAT Browser bleed-through — root causes found and fixed (3 files):**

The bleed persisted through multiple attempts because it had three separate causes
that all had to be resolved together.

1. `gui_layout.py` v32 — `content_splitter.setAutoFillBackground` False to True.
   The main splitter was not painting its own background.

2. `dat_browser.py` v4 — `integrate_dat_browser #vers 6`: widget was parented to
   `main_window` instead of `left_stack`. Qt paint coordinates were relative to
   `main_window`, so content drew at wrong position over whatever was beneath.

3. `dat_browser.py` v4 — `paintEvent #vers 1` and `showEvent #vers 1` added.
   No background fill was happening before child widgets rendered. paintEvent now
   fills Window palette colour first. showEvent forces repaint on every panel switch.

## May 2026 — Model Workshop QPainter fix, DAT browser paint

**Model Workshop docked bleed + QPainter crash fixed (`model_workshop.py` v100):**
- `__init__ #vers 11`: `FramelessWindowHint` now only set when `standalone_mode`
  is True. When docked as tab child, the flag broke QPainter (engine==0 spam)
  and caused wrong colours/bleed. Standalone behaviour unchanged.

**DAT Browser background clear (`dat_browser.py` v4):**
- `paintEvent #vers 1`: fills Window palette colour before children paint.
- `showEvent #vers 1`: calls `repaint()` each time panel becomes visible.

## May 2026 — DAT browser parent fix (root cause)

**DAT browser bleed root cause fixed (`dat_browser.py` v3):**
- `integrate_dat_browser #vers 6`: widget was parented to `main_window` instead
  of `left_stack` — Qt paint coordinates were wrong, causing DAT browser content
  to draw over whatever was rendered before it. Parent now set to `left_stack`.
- Duplicate `gl`/`left_stack` lookup removed.

## May 2026 — Intro->DAT bleed fix

**Right panel bleed fixed (`gui_layout_custom.py` v14):**
- `_ensure_left_panel_visible #vers 2`: added `splitter.widget(1).repaint()` and
  `splitter.update()` after `setSizes` — intro collapses right panel to 0px;
  switching to DAT/Dir Tree now forces right panel to repaint on restore.
- `_show_dat_browser #vers 5`: no logic change, version bump for tracking.
- Dir Tree unaffected (intro never opened from Dir Tree context).

## May 2026 — Panel bleed-through, repaint on stack switch

**Panel switch bleed fixed (`gui_layout_custom.py` v13):**
- `_show_dir_tree #vers 3`: `left_stack.repaint()` after `setCurrentIndex(0)`.
- `_show_dat_browser #vers 4`: `left_stack.repaint()` after `setCurrentIndex(1)`.
- `_show_intro_panel #vers 5`: `left_stack.repaint()` after `setCurrentIndex(2)`.
  QStackedWidget was not repainting on page switch — previous panel content bled through.

**DAT Browser internal splitter fixed (`dat_browser.py` v2):**
- `DATBrowserWidget #vers 3`: internal `splitter.setAutoFillBackground` changed
  False to True — same bleed root cause as content_splitter in gui_layout.py.

## May 2026 — Bleed-through fix, Model Workshop open bug

**Bleed-through rendering fixed (`gui_layout.py`, `welcome_screen.py`):**
- `content_splitter.setAutoFillBackground` changed False to True — splitter
  now paints its own background; intro/DAT browser no longer bleeds through
  when panels collapse or switch.
- `WelcomeScreen.__init__ #vers 1`: added `WA_OpaquePaintEvent` attribute and
  `setAutoFillBackground(True)` — screen is fully opaque, no ghost pixels.

**Model-Workshop open error dialog fixed (`Model-Workshop/Mdl_Editor/model_workshop.py`):**
- `open_workshop #vers 4`: `App_name * " Error"` corrected to
  `App_name + " Error"` — was a Python TypeError on any open failure.

## April 2026 — Standalone structure fixes, theme-aware colors

**Standalone repo structure fixed:**
- Col-Workshop: `col_dialogs.py`, `col_display.py`, `col_gui_integration.py` moved to `gui/`
- Txd-Workshop: `depends/` removed, files moved to `methods/`; `txd_context_menu.py` to `gui/`
- Model-Workshop: `col_dialogs.py` moved to `gui/`
- Radar-Workshop: `_get_ui_color` added to all 4 widget classes

**TODOs tracked (from audit):**
- `gui_template.py`: missing SVG icons for Model/Spheres/Boxes/Mesh/Vertices tabs
- `gui_template.py`: dock/tearoff buttons need SVG icons
- `col_workshop.py`: COL save/export/import stubs not implemented
- `txd_workshop.py`: bumpmap preview, format conversion stubs
- `right_click_actions.py`: DFF/TXD edit/view actions not implemented
- `shortcuts.py`: search/find/debug shortcuts not implemented
- `model_workshop.py`: OBJ import/export not implemented

## April 2026 — TXD Workshop UI, DP5 Workshop major update, Bug fixes

**Theme icon refresh fixed (`gui_layout.py`):**
- `refresh_icons #vers 3`: added missing `get_search_icon` and `get_tree_icon`
  imports. Fixed `f_entries_btn` using `get_twin_panel_icon` instead of
  `get_tree_icon` — icons now update correctly on dark/light theme switch.

**app_settings_system synced from master (`apps/utils/app_settings_system.py`):**
- Updated from v65 to v69 to match App-Settings-System repo.

### Build 324–335 — Menu system fixes, DP5 docked access, unified titlebar tool button

**System UI mode crash fixed (`imgfactory.py`):**
- `_apply_img_menu_orientation #vers 2`: `hasattr(gui_layout, 'menu_btn')`
  returned True even when `menu_btn = None` (set explicitly in system UI mode).
  Guard changed to `getattr(..., None) is not None` — no more crash on
  Settings apply in system UI mode.

**DP5 docked — internal menubar reappearing fixed (`gui_menu.py` v24):**
- `_inject_tool_menu #vers 2`: removed block that called
  `self.menu_bar.setVisible(True)` in custom UI mode. Native bar is
  hard-clamped hidden; Menu button popup is the entry point in custom mode.

**DP5 standalone corner resize handles restored (`dp5_workshop.py`):**
- `_setup_corner_overlay #vers 3`: guards against non-frameless/non-standalone
  mode, calls `overlay.show()` before `raise_()`.
- `showEvent #vers 2`: two-shot timer (100ms + 400ms) so overlay raises
  after layout settles and after all children render.
- `resizeEvent #vers 1`: re-raises overlay 50ms after every resize.

**DP5 docked — gap below menubar fixed (`dp5_workshop.py`):**
- Toolbar not added to `main_layout` at all when docked — `setFixedHeight(0)`
  was insufficient because child buttons with fixed sizes prevented the
  container shrinking to zero. Skipping `addWidget()` eliminates the ghost space.

**DP5 docked — menu access via titlebar `[DP5]` button:**
- `dp5_workshop.py`: when docked, registers a `[DP5]` button in the imgfactory
  custom titlebar (between `[Menu]` and `[Settings]`). Clicking pops up the
  full DP5 menu (File/Edit/Picture/View/Tools/Platform) as a `QMenu` dropdown.
- Internal `_menu_bar_container` kept hidden when docked — no second bar.
- `_unregister_titlebar_tool_btn` called on tab change to hide the button.

**Unified titlebar tool button — all workshops (`tool_menu_mixin.py` v2):**
- `_register_titlebar_tool_btn`: added to `ToolMenuMixin` base so every
  workshop inherits it automatically. Builds a `QMenu` from
  `_build_menus_into_qmenu()` and registers with `gui_layout_custom`'s
  `register_tool_menu_btn()`.
- `_unregister_titlebar_tool_btn`: clears button on tab change.
- Workshop short labels for titlebar button:
  - COL Workshop → `[COL]`
  - Model Workshop → `[DFF]`
  - TXD Workshop → `[TXD]`
  - DP5 Workshop → `[DP5]`
- `gui_layout_custom.py v7`: `tool_menu_btn` QPushButton added between
  `menu_btn` and `settings_btn`; `register_tool_menu_btn()` /
  `unregister_tool_menu_btn()` / `_show_tool_menu_popup()` helpers added.
- `imgfactory.py _update_tool_menu_for_tab #vers 2`: calls
  `_register_titlebar_tool_btn()` / `unregister_tool_menu_btn()` on tab change.

**Combined build number (`app_info.py` v2):**
- `App_imgfactory_version = N` mirrors `Version: N` comment in `imgfactory.py`.
- `get_full_build()` returns `"Build 335.78"` — release.fileversion.
- Rule: increment `App_imgfactory_version` on every change to `imgfactory.py`.
- Title bar and custom titlebar label both use `get_full_build()`.


### Build 319–323 — Menu system unification, resize fixes, welcome screen height fix

**Double menubar eliminated (`gui_menu.py` v23):**
- `IMGFactoryMenuBar.__init__ #vers 2`: native Qt `self.menuBar()` is now
  suppressed (`setVisible(False)`, `setFixedHeight(0)`, `setSizePolicy(Ignored)`)
  *before* `_create_menus()` populates it. Previously the native bar was filled
  with File/Edit/Settings/Tools menus and rendered on screen before the
  suppression code in `_create_ui()` ran, producing two visible menu rows.
- `menu_bar` pointer still starts on the native bar and is re-pointed to the
  inline `_system_menu_bar` widget (embedded in the top button row) by
  `imgfactory._create_ui()` after `gui_layout` builds it.

**DP5 Workshop dual menu eliminated (`dp5_workshop.py` v4):**
- Internal `_menu_bar_container` is now **standalone-only**. When docked,
  it is always `setFixedHeight(0)` / hidden — imgfactory's top bar owns
  the menus via `ToolMenuMixin` injection. Eliminates the second menu row
  that appeared when DP5 docked into IMG Factory.
- `set_menu_orientation #vers 5`: docked mode always suppresses the internal
  bar regardless of style setting; explicitly notifies imgfactory to
  inject/remove the tool menu via `menu_bar_system`.

**Resize handles restored (`gui_layout.py` v6, `imgfactory.py`):**
- `create_main_ui_with_splitters #vers 6`: `QSizeGrip` added at bottom-right
  of main layout. Gives a native OS resize handle in system-titlebar mode
  without requiring the custom corner overlay triangles.
- `showEvent #vers 2`: corner overlay only created when `FramelessWindowHint`
  is set — system titlebar mode now defers resize to KDE/Qt natively.
- `mousePressEvent #vers 10`, `mouseMoveEvent #vers 4`, `mouseReleaseEvent #vers 4`:
  all resize/drag logic gated behind `is_frameless` check. In system titlebar
  mode events pass straight through to Qt/KDE.

**Window geometry clamped to screen (`imgfactory.py`):**
- `_restore_settings #vers 2`: after `restoreGeometry()`, window size and
  position are clamped to `screen.availableGeometry()`. Fixes window going
  off-screen due to stale saved geometry (e.g. from old double-menubar height
  inflating the saved size). Stale geometry can be cleared with:
  `python3 -c "from PyQt6.QtCore import QSettings; QSettings('XSeti','IMGFactory').remove('geometry')"`

**Welcome screen height stretch fixed (`welcome_screen.py` v4, `imgfactory.py`):**
- `_build_ui #vers 3`: removed stretch factor `1` from `root.addWidget(tabs, 1)`.
  The stretch was telling Qt to demand all available vertical space, inflating
  the entire window past the screen height on startup.
- `__init__`: `setSizePolicy(Expanding, Preferred)` so height is governed by
  `sizeHint` rather than infinite expansion.
- Embed site in `imgfactory.py`: `ws.setMaximumHeight(600)` as a hard backstop.


### Build 234 — DAT Browser: IMG/CDIMAGE fix, theme-aware UI overhaul

**DAT Browser — IMG/CDIMAGE archives now visible:**
- `gta_dat_parser.py _inject_enforced_imgs #vers 3`: `models/gta3.img` is always
  loaded by the game executable for GTA3, VC, SA and SOL — it never appears in
  any `.dat` file. Now injected into `load_log` with phase `"enforced"` so the
  DAT Browser tree, Dump TXDs, and XRef all see it.
- `_process_dat #vers 3`: IMG/CDIMAGE entries from `.dat` files are now appended
  to `load_log` (previously only IDE/IPL were logged). This makes all CDIMAGE paths
  in SOL's `gta_sol.dat` (`sol\cdimages\*.img`) visible in the tree.
- `load #vers 5` + `load_from_dat`: both call `_inject_enforced_imgs(game_root)`
  before parsing, so `gta3.img` appears whether loading via game root or direct dat path.
- Dedup by normalised basename stem prevents `gta3.img` / `radartex.img` appearing
  twice when they are listed in both the enforced set and an explicit CDIMAGE line.
- DAT Browser load-order tree now shows IMG/CDIMAGE entries with file size badge.

**DAT Browser — theme-aware stylesheet (no more black bleed):**
- Root cause: `widget.setStyleSheet(big_ss)` overrides `QApplication` global
  stylesheet for that widget and all children, causing black fallback on anything
  not explicitly styled. Dir Tree worked because it never set a widget stylesheet.
- Fix: `_apply_theme_stylesheet #vers 3` now sets only a minimal 2-rule override
  (`alternate-background-color` for row colouring). Everything else inherits from
  `QApplication.instance().setStyleSheet(app_settings.get_stylesheet())`.
- `_on_theme_changed #vers 4` simplified — just calls `_apply_theme_stylesheet()`.

**All workshops — same stylesheet fix:**
- `col_workshop`, `txd_workshop`, `model_workshop`, `dp5_workshop`
  `_apply_theme #vers 5`: applies `app_settings.get_stylesheet()` to `QApplication`
  then calls `self.setStyleSheet("")` to clear any widget-level override.

**Shared theme module `apps/methods/workshop_theme.py` (new):**
- `get_theme_colors(main_window)` — reads app_settings, merges with dark defaults.
- `build_stylesheet(colors)` — comprehensive stylesheet covering all Qt widget types.
- `apply_workshop_theme(widget, main_window)` — used by dp5, dolphin dialog,
  directory tree as a fallback when no app_settings is connected.

**Model Workshop — open_model_workshop #vers 2:**
- Docks in `main_tab_widget` tab when available; floats standalone otherwise.
- Routes by extension: `.dff → open_dff_file()`, `.col → open_col_file()`,
  `.img → load_from_img_archive()`.
- Fixed `App_name * " Error"` string multiplication bug → correct error log.

**Model Workshop — Combined DFF + TXD open dialog (`_open_dff_standalone #vers 2`):**
- Two-row dialog: DFF path + optional TXD path.
- Auto-find TXD checkbox: if same-stem `.txd` exists alongside the `.dff`,
  fills TXD field automatically on Browse.
- On accept: `open_dff_file(dff)` then `_load_txd_file(txd)` in one step.

**Preview backgrounds — all three workshops:**
- `COL3DViewport._set_theme_bg(palette)`: auto-picks `(245,245,245)` on light
  themes, `(25,25,35)` on dark. Fires on first `paintEvent` only; user colour
  picks lock `_theme_bg_set=True`.
- `ZoomablePreview.bg_color = None` (was `QColor(42,42,42)`): paintEvent reads
  palette lightness and picks appropriate background automatically.

**gui_context.py — stub functions implemented:**
- `edit_dff_model #vers 2`: extracts DFF from IMG to tempfile → Model Workshop.
- `edit_txd_textures #vers 2`: calls `open_txd_workshop_docked`.
- `view_dff_model`, `view_txd_textures`: delegate to edit counterparts.

**imgfactory.py — `_on_tab_changed`:** added ModelWorkshop detection block.

### Build 234 — DP5 Workshop: new tools, palette, FGBGSwatch, zoom, splitter

**DP5 Workshop — New brush tools (in gadget grid):**
- `TOOL_BLUR_BRUSH` (B): Gaussian-soften pixels in brush radius (3-pass box blur,
  circular falloff). Continuous on mouse-drag.
- `TOOL_SMUDGE` (U): Drag/smear pixels from previous mouse position, 40% blend strength.
- `TOOL_LIGHTEN` (`,`): Dodge brush — adds +30 RGB with feathered falloff by distance.
- `TOOL_DARKEN` (`.`): Burn brush — subtracts 30 RGB with feathered falloff.
  All four preserve alpha channel.

**DP5 Workshop — New SVG icons:** `dp_blur_brush_icon` (concentric rings),
  `dp_smudge_icon` (curved drag trail), `dp_lighten_icon` (8-ray sun),
  `dp_darken_icon` (crescent moon), `dp_seamless_op_icon` (4-tile wave grid),
  `dp_colour_correct_icon` (RGB slider bars with coloured handles).

**DP5 Workshop — Image operation buttons (right panel, above retro palette):**
  4 × 32px icon buttons: Colour Adjustments, Seamless Tool, Snow Effect, Zoom Lens.
  All use txd_tools.py dialogs and push undo before applying.

**DP5 Workshop — Image tools (Image menu):**
  Colour Adjustments, Seamless Tool, Snow Effect, Filters submenu
  (Sharpen ×1.5, ×3, Blur r=1, Blur r=2, Emboss, Edge Detect).

**DP5 Workshop — Zoom Lens window:**
  Stay-on-top QWidget.Tool, 320×340px. Magnification slider 2–32×.
  10fps QTimer reads canvas rgba directly, crops the viewport-centred region.
  Single instance — re-focuses if already open. Image menu → Zoom Lens…

**DP5 Workshop — Zoom range 0.05× – 64× (was 16×):**
  All zoom paths updated: _set_zoom(), wheel, zoom-in button, settings spin.

**DP5 Workshop — FGBGSwatch auto-resize:**
  Removed `setFixedSize(64,48)` — now Expanding/Preferred with min 40×30.
  Scales proportionally with right panel width via `heightForWidth(w)=0.75×w`.

**DP5 Workshop — Image palette auto-wrap:**
  `PaletteGrid` auto-fills columns = width ÷ cell_size on every resize.
  Max height uncapped (was img_rows×12 fixed cap). `_fit_img_pal_height()`
  called after canvas extraction to snap the scroll area to content height.

**DP5 Workshop — User palette auto-cell:**
  New `_AutoCellPaletteGrid` subclass: fixed column count, cell size =
  width ÷ columns. Swatches always tile edge-to-edge regardless of panel width.

**DP5 Workshop — Gadget bar fills available width:**
  Column count = `max(min_cols, (panel_w − 20) ÷ (btn_sz + gap))`.
  `min_cols` is from Settings (floor, not ceiling). Gadget grid reflows on
  splitter drag via `_on_splitter_moved` (rebuilds only when column count changes).
  Removed `setFixedWidth`, `QSizePolicy.Fixed`, and `setMaximumWidth(sizeHint)` —
  all three were locking the panel and preventing the splitter from moving left.
  With 24px icons: 150px→4 cols, 200px→5, 300px→8, 400px→11.

**DP5 Workshop — Splitter position saved:**
  `closeEvent` writes `[left, canvas, right]` sizes to dp5_workshop.json.
  Restored via `QTimer.singleShot(0, setSizes)` on next open.

**DP5 Workshop — Icon size fix:**
  Removed silent `min(icon_sz, 24)` cap when docked — user's setting is
  applied directly. Icon spinbox minimum lowered from 20 to 16px.

**TXD Workshop — Right navbar 2-column grid:**
  All preview controls (zoom/pan/BG/resize/checker/colour picker + 4 tool buttons)
  converted from 40px single-column (560px tall, clips badly) to 28px 2-column
  grid (~270px total). Tile cycle button removed (tiling in Tools menu only).

**TXD Workshop — Left transform icon panel 2-column grid:**
  17 buttons converted from single 45px column (~400px tall) to 2-column 78px
  grid (~220px). `_place_icon_grid(n_cols)` can reflow to more columns.

**TXD Workshop — XTD parser (renamed from RAGE):**
  `apps/methods/xtd_textures.py` (was rage_textures.py). All public names:
  `XTDDict`, `XTDTexture`, `open_xtd_dict`, `is_xtd_file`, `get_xtd_game`.
  Hidden behind "All Texture Files" filter — no menu entry or documentation.

**TXD Workshop — Texture tools:**
  `ColourAdjustDialog`: brightness/contrast/hue/sat/sharpness/opacity/cutout/premultiply.
  `SeamlessDialog`: wrap-blend, patch/heal, histogram-preserving, offset+mirror.
  `SnowDialog`: layered snow with luminance-biased noise.
  `scale_alpha_for_coverage()`: binary-search alpha scaling for SA foliage/fences.
  All accessible via Tools menu and right navbar buttons.

**Model Workshop — DFF→COL surface generation:**
  `_dff_to_col_surfaces(single/batch)`: keyword-maps texture names to GTA surface IDs,
  interactive assignment table, COL version selector, mesh face toggle.
  Batch mode processes a directory of .dff files. COL menu added to Model Workshop.

**Bug fixes:**
- `txd_tools.py _apply_snow()`: `from scipy.ndimage import sobel` was outside
  the try block. Moved inside try; `np.gradient()` fallback added.
- `gui_layout.py edit_txd_file()`: `os` UnboundLocalError — `import os` inside
  nested if, used at function level. Moved to top of try.
- `txd_workshop.py _create_preview_controls()`: `QSize`, `QIcon`, `QPainter`,
  `QPixmap`, `QByteArray`, `QSvgRenderer`, `SVGIconFactory` all imported inside
  nested closures but used at function level. All hoisted to function top.
- `_get_current_rgba()`: replaced non-existent `_get_selected_texture_index()`
  with `self.selected_texture`.
- `_set_current_rgba()`: replaced non-existent `_update_preview()` with
  `_update_texture_info(selected_texture)`.
- All tool methods (`_open_colour_adjust` etc.): replaced non-existent
  `_set_status()` with `self.status_label.setText()` guarded by `hasattr`.
- `model_workshop.py`: fixed `COLModelListWidget` → `ModelListWidget` (lines 9348, 9986).
- `DP5 Workshop _AutoCellPaletteGrid`: `_fixed_cols` must be set before
  `super().__init__()` since parent calls `_recalc_height()` in `__init__`.
- `DP5 Workshop setup_ui()`: `QTimer` imported inside conditional `if _saved_sizes`
  block but used unconditionally two lines later. Import hoisted above the if.

## April 2026 — TXD Workshop, Model Workshop, XTD Parser, Bug Fixes

### Build 233 — TXD Workshop texture tools + XTD parser + DFF→COL + UI fixes

**TXD Workshop — Texture Tools:**
- `ColourAdjustDialog`: Brightness / Contrast / Hue / Saturation / Sharpness / Opacity sliders,
  Cutout Alpha Threshold (toggle + value), Premultiplied Alpha. Live before/after preview at 360px.
- `SeamlessDialog`: 4 methods — Wrap Blend (gradient fade), Patch/Heal, Histogram-Preserving
  Blend, Offset+Mirror. 1×1/2×2/3×3 tiled preview to evaluate seam quality. Pure Python/numpy.
- `SnowDialog`: layered snow accumulation with luminance-biased noise.
  B/W threshold, depth, coverage%, layers, tile controls.
- `scale_alpha_for_coverage()`: binary search scales alpha channel so mip levels preserve
  mip-0 opaque pixel fraction. Fixes SA foliage/fences disappearing at distance.
- All tools accessible from Tools menu, preview sidebar buttons, and cycle tile button.

**TXD Workshop — Right navbar (2-column icon grid):**
- Tile preview cycle button: one click steps 1×1 → 2×2 → 3×3 → 1×1.
  Icon updates each step to show the current grid pattern.
- Tool buttons (2×2 grid): knob (Colour Adjustments), wave-grid (Seamless),
  snowflake (Snow), shield-α (Alpha Coverage).
- Transform icon panel docked: reduced from 32px/20px icon to 24px/16px.

**XTD Parser (renamed from RAGE parser):**
- `apps/methods/xtd_textures.py`: read-only RAGE texture dictionary importer.
  RSC7 (GTA IV .wtd) and RSC8 (GTA V / RDR2 .ytd) formats.
  DXT1/3/5, BC4, BC5, RGBA8, BGRA8 decoded in pure Python.
  Opened via File > Open like any .txd — no menu entry, no documentation.
- All internal names renamed: `XTDDict`, `XTDTexture`, `open_xtd_dict`,
  `is_xtd_file`, `get_xtd_game`, `_open_xtd_file`.

**Model Workshop — DFF→COL surface generation:**
- `_dff_to_col_surfaces(single, batch)`: parses DFF geometry materials,
  maps texture names to GTA surface type IDs using keyword matching
  (road/concrete/sand/grass/water/wood/metal/glass/rock/foliage/snow etc.).
- Interactive surface assignment table with per-row ComboBox override.
- COL version selector (COL1/2/3), mesh face toggle.
- Batch mode: pick directory, processes all .dff files.
- Generates COLModel with bounds from DFF bounding sphere + full face/vertex geometry.
- COL menu in Model Workshop: Build COL from DFF / Batch COL from DFFs /
  Convert Surface / New Surface.

**DP5 Workshop docked:**
- Icons capped at 24px when docked (was up to 64px).
- Column count stays 3+ (reduces height, not width).

**New SVG icons in SVGIconFactory:**
- `knob_icon`: rotary dial (Colour Adjustments)
- `seamless_icon`: 4-square grid with wave (Seamless tool)
- `snow_icon`: 8-arm snowflake (Snow effect)
- `alpha_coverage_icon`: shield with italic 'a' (Alpha Coverage)

**Bug fixes:**
- `gui_layout.py edit_txd_file()`: `os` UnboundLocalError — `import os` was inside
  a nested `if` block but used at function scope level. Moved to top of `try` block.
- `txd_workshop.py _create_preview_controls()`: `QSize` UnboundLocalError —
  `from PyQt6.QtCore import QSize` was inside a deeply nested closure but `QSize`
  was used throughout the function. All imports hoisted to function top.
  Same fix applied to `QIcon`, `QPainter`, `QPixmap`, `QByteArray`, `QSvgRenderer`,
  `SVGIconFactory`.
- `_get_current_rgba()`: removed call to non-existent `_get_selected_texture_index()`.
  Now uses `self.selected_texture` directly.
- `_set_current_rgba()`: removed call to non-existent `_update_preview()`.
  Now calls `_update_texture_info(selected_texture)`.
- All tool methods (`_open_colour_adjust`, `_open_seamless_tool`, `_open_snow_tool`,
  `_open_alpha_coverage`, `_set_tiled_preview`): removed calls to non-existent
  `_set_status()`. Now uses `self.status_label.setText()` with `hasattr` guard.
- `model_workshop.py`: fixed pre-existing `COLModelListWidget` → `ModelListWidget`
  name errors at lines 9348 and 9986.

## April 2026 — DP5 Workshop: Builds 278-299

### Build 299 — Amiga .info import rewritten from SDK docs
- `_decode_amiga_info` v2: correct DiskObject/Gadget/Image struct offsets per official AmigaOS SDK
- Reads Image.Depth from struct at `base+8` — handles 2bp/4bp/8bp correctly
- DrawerData offset: 78 + (56 if do_DrawerData != NULL)

#this belongs in root /ChangeLog.md - Version: 35

## April 2026 — DP5 Workshop: Build 249–292b

### Build 292b — Restore wiped export methods
- `dp5_workshop.py`: restored `_export_amiga_icon`, `_export_ico`, `_export_svg_icon`, `_export_tga`, `_export_dds`, `_export_pcx`, `_import_icns`, `_export_icns` — all lost in batch convertor insertion

### Build 292+ — Amiga .info import fix + batch converters
- `_import_amiga_info` v3: correct bitplane offset formula — `DiskObject(78) + DrawerData(56 if present) + 2×Image_struct(40)` — confirmed against icon collection
- `_decode_amiga_info`: detects Classic-bitplane (68 icons), NewIcon IM1= (1), OS3.5 ICONFACE (45, reported unsupported), GlowIcon ARGB

- File menu: `Open + snap to palette…` (hard snap) and `Open + snap to palette (dithered)…` (asks Floyd-Steinberg/Bayer/Checkerboard)
- Picture menu: `Snap to user palette` and `Snap to user palette (dithered)…`
- `_snap_canvas_to_user_palette_dither`: QInputDialog method picker
- Palette dither hidden button removed — dither via menu only

### Build 289a — Fix crashes
- `_import_amiga_info` v2: QPoint unpacking crash fixed — `_preview_start/end` stored as `(tx,ty)` tuples not QPoint
- `get_dp5_workshop_icon` v4: SVG path data on single lines — fixes `qt.svg: Invalid path data; path truncated` warnings

### Build 289 — Zoom tool right-click mode menu + Open+snap dither
- `_zoom_mode_menu`: right-click zoom gadget → Zoom In / Zoom Out / Box Zoom / Zoom to Fit
- `_set_zoom_mode`: sets mode, updates tooltip, cursor (CrossCursor for box, SizeAll for out)
- Box zoom: drag cyan dashed rectangle → zoom to fit selection, scroll to centre
- `_import_bitmap_snap_user_pal` v2: uses current dither mode in title + snap

### Build 288 — Full IFF ILBM decoder
- Custom decoder handles 24-bit, 8-bit, HAM6/HAM8/EHB, PackBits — PIL only used as fallback

### Build 287 — Palette grid fix + ZX80/81 differentiated
- `PaletteGrid.set_colors/set_palette_raw` v3: 4096-colour palettes use 64 cols×1px = 64×64px square (was 16px wide — invisible)
- ZX80: hard threshold B&W (character cell mode); ZX81 WRX: Bayer 4×4 dither

### Build 286 — Extended import/export formats
- Import: IFF, TIFF, GIF (animated→timeline), TGA, PCX, DDS, PSD, Amiga .info, Apple ICNS, Windows ICO, SVG
- Export: TGA, DDS (BGRA8 128-byte header), PCX, Apple ICNS (multi-size PNG chunks)

### Build 278 — Standalone repo synced; drop-in folder structure
- `X-Seti/Deluxe-Paint-Clone---Img-Factory` updated to Build 292; README updated with full feature list; header updated to reflect standalone/drop-in usage

#this belongs in root /ChangeLog.md - Version: 34

## April 2026 — DP5 Workshop: full paint editor suite, imgfactory integration

### DP5 Workshop — standalone repo
- `X-Seti/Deluxe-Paint-Clone---Img-Factory` created as a separate MIT-licensed repository
- Contains `dp5_workshop.py`, `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `LICENSE`
- Usable standalone (`python3 dp5_workshop.py`) or embedded in any PyQt6 app
- Synced from `apps/components/DP5_Workshop/dp5_workshop.py`

### Build 248 — Revert toolbar changes, Paint Edit in right panel, TXD → DP5
- `gui_layout_custom.py`: reverted — removed misplaced Load/Save/Import/Export/Undo/PaintEdit from main IMG Factory toolbar
- `gui_layout.py`: **Paint Edit** added to Editing Options right panel (after Dff Edit), calls `open_dp5_workshop_docked()`
- `txd_workshop.py`: `_open_paint_editor()` v4 — replaced old `dp5_paint_editor.py` with full `DP5Workshop`
  - Opens as modal QDialog, pre-loads selected texture RGBA into canvas, auto-fits zoom
  - **Apply to Texture** writes edited RGBA bytes back into texture dict and marks TXD modified

### Build 247 — DP5 icon redesign + SVG icons on all toolbar/gadget buttons
- `get_dp5_workshop_icon()` v2: solid filled palette body, bold outline circles, thick brush stroke — readable at 16px+
- `get_clear_canvas_icon()`: bold X on canvas rect — used on CLR gadget button
- `get_brushes_icon()`: three brush shapes — used on Brushes toolbar button
- All `dp5_workshop.py` toolbar buttons now carry SVG icons:
  - Load=`open_icon`, Save=`save_icon`, Import=`import_icon`, Export=`export_icon`, Undo=`undo_icon`, Brushes=`get_brushes_icon`
  - UNDO gadget = `undo_icon`, CLR gadget = `get_clear_canvas_icon`
- `icon_color` now defined in `_create_right_panel` (was missing, causing gadget icon errors)

### Build 246c — Window/app icon in taskbar and alt-tab
- `DP5Workshop.__init__`: `setWindowIcon(get_dp5_workshop_icon(64))`
- `open_dp5_workshop()`: sets icon on standalone window
- `__main__`: `setApplicationName("DP5 Workshop")`, `setOrganizationName("X-Seti")`, `app.setWindowIcon()` — replaces python3/X in taskbar with DP5 palette icon

### Build 246b — Toolbar reorder
- Layout: `[Settings*] ←title→ [Load][Save][Import][Export][Undo] [Brushes] [Theme] [_][□][×]*`
- Settings and window chrome visible only in standalone mode
- Import/Export tooltips note older format support (IFF, BMP)

### Build 246a — Fix `_activate_stamp_mode` missing
- `_on_brush_mgr_selected` had orphaned `_activate_stamp_mode` body merged into it as a string literal
- Restored as proper method: selects `TOOL_STAMP` and sets status bar message

### Build 246 — DP5 Workshop fully integrated into IMG Factory
- `imgfactory.py`: `open_dp5_workshop_docked()` — same pattern as AI/TXD/COL/Model workshops
  - Finds existing tab, creates QWidget container, adds tab with DP5 icon, registers in tool taskbar
  - `open_dp5_workshop_standalone()` convenience wrapper
  - Both accept optional `file_path` to auto-load an image on open
- `gui_layout_custom.py`: `[Paint Edit]` button with DP5 icon in toolbar; left-click = docked, right-click = standalone; `_show_paint_context_menu()`; `dp5` key in tool routing dict and context menu branch
- `imgfactory_svg_icons.py`: `get_dp5_workshop_icon()` — paint palette SVG, attached as `SVGIconFactory.dp5_workshop_icon`
- `dp5_workshop.py`: `_import_bitmap_path(path)` for imgfactory docked call; `BrushManager` floating panel; `_toggle_brush_manager()`; toolbar rebuilt with file action buttons; DP5 palette icon in title

### Build 245 — Stamp mode, brush thumbnail, moveable floating objects
- `TOOL_STAMP`: click anywhere to place copy buffer — ghost preview follows cursor at 55% opacity
- `BrushThumbnail` widget (right of FG/BG swatch): checkerboard background, shows copy buffer preview, cyan active border, click = stamp mode, right-click = clear
- After Ctrl+X / Ctrl+C thumbnail updates automatically; Ctrl+V enters stamp mode instead of dropping at centre
- `_activate_stamp_mode()`, `_clear_brush()`, `_sync_brush_thumb()` wired throughout
- Escape exits stamp mode back to Select tool

### Build 244 — SVG icon lookup in `_make_tool_icon`
- `_SVG_MAP` dict maps shape keys → `SVGIconFactory.dp_*_icon()` method names
- When `ICONS_AVAILABLE` and the shape has an entry, calls the SVG method with tile background
- Falls back to QPainter renderer for shapes not yet in the map
- Currently mapped: pencil, eraser, fill, spray, picker, line, zoom

### Build 243 — Right-click fill toggle for shape tools
- `SHAPE_FILL_PAIRS`: rect/circle/triangle/polygon/star/lasso each have outline + filled variants
- Right-click the button toggles outline ↔ filled; icon updates immediately; tooltip shows current mode
- `ShapeToolButton` subclass intercepts right-click at Qt event level (no menu flash)
- `_shape_fill_state` dict tracks each shape's current mode; `_toggle_shape_fill()` updates icon + canvas tool live
- `TOOL_FILLED_TRIANGLE`, `TOOL_FILLED_POLYGON`, `TOOL_FILLED_STAR`, `TOOL_FILLED_LASSO` added
- Lasso fill: on release, draws outline then flood-fills from centroid

### Build 242 — Move tool as floating object + arrow key nudge
- `TOOL_MOVE` with copy buffer → auto-floats buffer at existing position
- Arrow keys: float active → nudge 1px (Shift = 10px); no float → scroll viewport
- Enter/Return stamps float permanently and clears buffer
- `nudge_float(dx, dy)` canvas helper
- Spacebar + drag = temporary canvas pan with any tool (ClosedHandCursor feedback)
- `TOOL_MOVE` removed from gadget bar (pan is middle-mouse + spacebar)

### Build 241 — Zoom-to-cursor + scrollable canvas (architecture overhaul)
- `DP5Canvas.sizeHint()` returns `tex_w × zoom, tex_h × zoom` — scroll area knows actual content size
- `setSizePolicy(Fixed, Fixed)` + `setWidgetResizable(False)` — canvas drives its own size
- `setAlignment(AlignCenter)` — canvas centred when smaller than viewport
- `paintEvent` draws at `(0,0)` — no more manual `self.offset` subtraction
- `_widget_to_tex` / `_tex_to_widget` simplified — no offset arithmetic
- `_set_zoom(z, anchor_widget_pos)` — resizes canvas, adjusts scrollbars to keep anchor fixed: `ratio = z/old_z; new_scroll = (old_scroll + anchor) * ratio - anchor`
- `wheelEvent` passes mouse position mapped to scroll area viewport as anchor
- Pan via `_scroll_by(dx, dy)` → scrollbar setValue (middle-mouse and spacebar)
- `_get_scroll_area()` walks parent chain to find containing QScrollArea

### Build 240 — Moveable selection with paste-as-you-go
- Committed selection: click inside → `_lift_selection()` (copies pixels, clears source, sets `_sel_floating=True`)
- Drag moves `_sel_float_pos`; release keeps float active (re-draggable)
- Float renders at 85% opacity with yellow dashed border tracking mouse
- Click outside → `_stamp_selection(keep_floating=False)` stamps permanently
- Escape while floating → `cancel_sel_move()` restores `_sel_float_orig` backup (full canvas backup before lift)
- `_point_in_sel_rect()`, `_lift_selection()`, `_stamp_selection()`, `cancel_sel_move()` canvas helpers
- `TOOL_SELECT` in `mousePressEvent`: detects click inside vs outside committed selection

### Builds 233–239 — DP5 Workshop core construction
- Single-file merge: DP5Canvas, PaletteGrid, FGBGSwatch, ColorPickerWidget, ColorPalPresetsMixin, DP5Settings, DP5SettingsDialog, DP5Workshop
- 19 tools: pencil, eraser, fill, spray, picker, curve, line, rect, circle, triangle, polygon, star, select, lasso, zoom, text, stamp (+ filled variants)
- `_make_tool_icon()`: normalised 48-unit QPainter icons with dark tile + white silhouette; active = inverted
- Adaptive column gadget bar (2/3/4 cols, auto from icon size); `_rebuild_right_panel()` via QSplitter.replaceWidget
- DP5Settings JSON at `~/.config/imgfactory/dp5_workshop.json`
- Retro palettes: Amiga OCS/AGA/AGA-WB, C64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari 800/2600, ULA Plus
- COL1/COL2/COL3 binary ops, Bézier curve (click-to-add control points, dbl-click commit), polygon (click vertices, dbl-click close+fill), text placement (QPainter render to canvas), brush size slider, snap-to-grid
- IFF ILBM export, PIL-based transforms (flip, rotate, scale, invert, brighten/darken)
- Zoom: Ctrl+scroll, click-zoom tool, menu presets 0.05×–16×
- Selection: marquee, lasso, cut/copy/paste, select-all, deselect; Ctrl+A/X/C/V/Z/Y


## March–April 2026 — TXD GTA3/VC fixes, COL ops, log dedup

### Build 180 — Fix PAL8/PAL4 pixel data offset (4-byte size prefix)
- **Root cause**: GTA3/VC TXD PAL8 layout is `palette(1024 raw) + pixel_size(4) + pixels(w*h)`
- DragonFF `read_palette()` reads palette raw with no prefix; `read_pixels()` always reads a 4-byte size prefix first
- Our code set `has_data_size_field=False` for GTA3/VC non-DXT, so `expected = 1024 + w*h` — no room for the pixel prefix
- `pix_data = level_data[1024:]` landed on the size field bytes `[0x00,0x10,0x00,0x00]`, treating them as pixel indices 0,16,0,0 — shifting every row by 4 pixels
- Fix: `expected = pal_size + 4 + pixel_data_size`; `pix_data = level_data[pal_size + 4:]`
- Verified against all 110 PAL8 textures in `generic.txd` — every one has `prefix == w*h`

### Build 179 — Align PAL4/PAL8 alpha with DragonFF txd.py
- **PAL4 palette size**: DragonFF `read_palette()` uses 64 bytes when `depth==4`, 128 bytes otherwise — we always used 64
- **PAL8/PAL4 alpha forcing**: DragonFF calls `pal8_noalpha()` (force alpha=255) when `has_alpha()==False`, which triggers for `RASTER_888`, `RASTER_565`, `RASTER_555`, `RASTER_LUM` pixel types (bits 8–11 of `raster_format_flags`)
- Old code only forced opaque for `palette_entry_fmt=='RGB888'`; now checks `raster_format_flags & 0x0F00` against no-alpha type set `{0x0600, 0x0200, 0x0A00, 0x0400}`
- Generic.txd `carlites64` has `raster_flags=0x2600` → pixel_type `0x0600` (RGB888) → `force_opaque=True` ✓

### Build 178 — Fix GTA3/VC PAL8+PAL4 wrong colours (BGRA vs RGBA)
- **Root cause confirmed** via `generic.txd` `carlites64`: GTA3/VC TXDs store palette entries as **RGBA**, not BGRA
- SA TXDs (`>= 0x1803FFFF`) store palettes as **BGRA** — our pre-existing B↔R swap was correct for SA only
- `carlites64` palette[0] stored bytes: `48,24,8,255`
  - Before fix: output `R=8, G=24, B=48` → cold blue (wrong)
  - After fix:  output `R=48, G=24, B=8` → warm brown (correct)
- Fix: `tex['palette_is_bgra'] = is_sa_plus` during header parse; `_decompress_uncompressed` v7 adds `palette_is_bgra` param and branches on it for both PAL8 and PAL4 decode paths
- DragonFF never swaps (outputs BGRA to Blender which handles it); our fix is more precise

### Build 177 — Fix duplicate timestamps in activity log
- `img_debugger._write()` formats lines as `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL message` then calls `log_message()`
- `gui_layout.log_message()` prepended another `[HH:MM:SS]` unconditionally → double-stamped output
- Fix: `re.match(r'^\[\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]', message)` — skip adding timestamp if already present

### Build 176 — ChangeLog v31
- Documented Builds 162–175

## March–April 2026 — COL parser overhaul, material paint, writer, IDE ops

### Build 175 — Select All, Invert, Sort, Pin, IDE ops, multi-delete
- **Ctrl+A**: Select All entries in active list
- **Ctrl+I**: Invert selection (QItemSelection toggle)
- **Sort menu** (right-click → Sort…): by name A→Z, version, faces/boxes/spheres/vertices descending
- **Pin / protect** (right-click → 📌 Pin): marks models as edit-locked, tracked in `_pinned_models` set
- **IDE Operations** submenu (right-click):
  - Import matched by IDE — parses `objs/tobj/anim` sections, highlights matching models
  - Export matched by IDE — writes IDE-referenced models to new .col archive
  - Remove unreferenced by IDE — deletes models not in IDE (archive cleanup)
- **Multi-delete** (`_delete_selected_model` v2): uses `currentRow()` + `selectedRows()` on visible list, deletes all selected from highest index down

### Build 174 — Fix selection, multi-select, IMG Factory COL fallback
- `_get_selected_model` v4: uses `currentRow()` (reliable with custom delegates) on **visible** list only; hidden list may have stale state
- Both `collision_list` and `col_compact_list` changed to `ExtendedSelection` — Ctrl+click, Shift+click now work
- Export reads all `selectedRows()` + `currentRow()` from visible list
- `_open_col_entry_smart()` in `imgfactory.py`: double-clicking `.col` in IMG file list tries COL Workshop first; falls back to inline QDialog showing model table (name, version, sphere/box/vertex/face/shadow counts) if COL Workshop not installed

### Build 173 — COL binary writer + working Import/Extract buttons
- **New file**: `apps/methods/col_workshop_writer.py` — serialises `COLModel` → binary .col
  - `model_to_bytes()`, `models_to_bytes()`, `save_col_file()`
  - Mirrors DragonFF `__write_col/__write_col_new` exactly
  - COL1: sequential count+data blocks with skip-4 between spheres and boxes
  - COL2/3: 36-byte `<HHHBxIIIIIII>` header, data blocks without count prefix, int16 fixed-point vertex compression, offsets as `(file_pos - 4) - start_offset`
  - Round-trip verified: 154-byte COL2 blob writes bit-identically
- **Import button** (`_import_col_data` v2): open .col files, append all models to current archive
- **Extract button** (`_export_col_data` v2): single → SaveDialog; multi/none → FolderDialog, each model as `modelname.col` with `_N` suffix for duplicates

### Build 172 — Fix COL2/3 multi-model archive advance
- `parse_model` was returning mid-parse offset for COL2/3 (data blocks read by jumping, not linearly)
- Loader used this wrong offset and jumped into the middle of the next model's data
- Fix: return `start_offset + header.size + 8` — the header-declared next model position (DragonFF: `pos + file_size + 8`)

### Build 171 — Fix COL2/3 SA parsing — 4 bugs from DragonFF reference
All SA COL2/3 files were silently failing. Root causes vs DragonFF `__read_new_col`:
1. **Wrong block_base**: was `start_offset + 8`; correct is `start_offset` (fourcc position). Stored offsets are `(file_pos - 4) - start_offset`, `data_at(off) = start_offset + off + 4`
2. **Missing flags field**: was reading `<HHHH>` (4 uint16) then 9 offsets; correct is `<HHHBxIIIIIII>` — sphere/box/face counts + line_count(B) + pad + flags(I) + 6 offsets
3. **Wrong offset order**: had `cones_off` between boxes and verts; DragonFF order is `spheres_off, boxes_off, lines_off, verts_off, faces_off, tri_off`
4. **Wrong vertex count method**: used `(faces_off - verts_off) / 6`; DragonFF derives from face indices: `max(a, b, c) + 1` across all faces

### Build 170 — Fix paint selection + cursor + drag-select (3 issues)
- `_get_selected_model` (initial attempt): tries both list widgets using row as index
- Default cursor changed from `OpenHandCursor` to `ArrowCursor` so pointer tip is precise during face selection
- Pan retains `ClosedHandCursor`; paint mode uses `CrossCursor`
- `_drag_selecting` flag: LMB held after clicking a face → `_pick_face()` called on every `mouseMoveEvent` → brush-style add to selection; in paint mode also paints each passed face

### Build 169 — Fix `_get_selected_model` wrong list lookup
- `col_compact_list` stores no `UserRole` — row index IS model index
- `collision_list` stores `UserRole` on col 0, not col 1
- Both paths now use row number directly, matching `_select_model_by_row`

### Build 168 — COL viewport face picking + material paint mode
- `_pick_face()`: centroid-based hit test, 20px pick radius; face loop uses `enumerate`
- Click face → selects it (yellow highlight); Ctrl+click multi-select; Escape deselects
- Material paint mode (`_open_paint_editor`): searchable picker of all 179 SA / 35 VC materials with group colour swatches; enter paint mode → crosshair cursor, HUD banner shows current material + `[Esc to exit]`; click/drag faces to paint; Escape exits; paint button shows 🔴 Exit Paint while active
- Viewport material colours: upgraded from 14-entry hardcoded dict to full `col_materials.py` group palette; auto-detects SA vs VC from COL version

### Build 167 — Rewrite `col_workshop_loader.py` — 6 bugs fixed
1. `_load_multi_model_archive()`: dead code referencing undefined `signatures` variable — removed
2. `is_multi_model()`: called `is_multi_model_archive()` as unbound function with no args — now `len(models) > 1`
3. Three divergent load paths (`load`, `load_from_file`, `load_from_data`) — all now funnel through `_load_bytes()` → `_parse_all_models()`
4. Missing `import struct` at module level
5. `get_info()` / `validate()`: inconsistent `model.name` access — unified to shortcut
6. `_parse_all_models` offset advance: was `max(parsed, next)` risking model skips — uses `parsed_end` when it advances, `next_offset` as fallback

### Build 166 — Fix COL1 parse order: skip-4 must follow sphere DATA not box data
- Build 163 moved the skip-4 to the right concept but wrong position — between boxes and vertices
- DragonFF `__read_legacy_col` places skip-4 **after sphere data, before `num_boxes`**
- Correct COL1 order: `num_spheres → spheres[] → skip4 → num_boxes → boxes[] → num_verts → verts[] → num_faces → faces[]`
- Fixed in both `parse_model()` and `parse_col1_model()`
- Verified with synthetic COL1: S=0 B=1 V=3 F=1 parses correctly

### Build 165 — Fix PAL4 nibble order + DXT5 alpha interpolation (TXD)
- **PAL4 decoder** (`_decompress_uncompressed`): nibble order was reversed — low nibble decoded first, swapping every pixel pair. High nibble = first pixel, low = second. Matches DragonFF: `idx1, idx2 = (i >> 4) & 0xf, i & 0xf`. Fixes shifted/scrambled PAL4 textures (GTA III era)
- **DXT5 alpha decoder**: interpolation uses `round()` with fractional weights matching DragonFF `bc3`; both `a0>a1` (6 intermediates) and `a0<=a1` (4 intermediates + 0/255) fixed
- **DXT5 alpha encoder** (`_encode_alpha_block`): was building wrong number of intermediates (5 or 3 instead of 6 or 4) causing encoder/decoder mismatch on exported textures

### Build 164 — Mesh editor: replace stale material dicts with `col_materials.py`
- Remove hardcoded `SURFACE_MATERIALS` (35 wrong entries) and `MATERIAL_COLORS`
- Import `col_materials`: `get_material_name`, `get_materials_for_version`, group colour cache
- Game version selector (SA / VC+GTA3) auto-detected from COL version on open
- `_refresh_material_combo()`: rebuilds Add Face combo (179 SA or 35 VC entries)
- `_on_game_changed()`: switches game, refreshes combo + face table + viewport
- Viewport face colours driven by group colour map (14 groups)

### Build 163 — Fix 4 COL1 parser bugs + add `col_materials.py`
Parser fixes verified against DragonFF:
- COL1 `parse_model`: removed bogus facegroups block, correct skip-4 after spheres
- `parse_boxes_alt`: COL1 box size was 32 bytes, correct is 28 (`VVS` = 12+12+4); surface reading fixed
- `parse_faces_alt`: COL1 faces read as uint16 (wrong), fixed to uint32×3 + surface = 16 bytes (`IIIS`)
- `COLBounds` dataclass: field defaults added so `COLBounds()` works

**New file**: `apps/methods/col_materials.py`
- Full SA material table (179 materials, 0–178 + vehicle presets)
- Full VC/GTA3 material table (35 materials + vehicle presets)
- Group colour map (14 groups with hex colours for viewport)
- API: `get_material_name/colour/group/qcolor`, `get_materials_for_version`, `get_vehicle_presets`, `material_id_from_name`

### Build 162 — Sync repos + ChangeLog v30
- Col-Workshop and Txd-Workshop repos synced to Build 161

### Duplicate log line bug (pending fix)
- `img_debugger._write()` formats `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL message` then calls `log_message(line)`
- `gui_layout.log_message()` (line 2736) prepends another `[HH:MM:SS]` before appending to QTextEdit
- Results in double-stamped lines: `[18:23:50] [18:23:50] DEBUG Populating...`
- Fix: check if message already starts with `[DD:DD:DD]` before prepending timestamp

## March 2026 — COL Workshop list views, parser fixes, repo sync

### Build 161 — Fix viewport not rendering on model click
- `open_col_file` called `_on_collision_selected()` which read from
  hidden detail table (always empty) — now calls `_select_model_by_row(0)`
- `set_current_model` resets pan/zoom so each model is centred on load

### Build 160 — Three bugs fixed
- Bug 1: `table.setVisible(True)` NoneType crash in colour_ui_for_loaded_img
- Bug 2: `open_col_editor(entry)` — method lacked entry param, fixed
- Bug 3: COL2/3 parser rewritten with correct offset-table layout:
    counts: num_spheres(u16) num_boxes(u16) num_faces(u16) num_lines(u16)
    offsets: 9 x uint32 relative to block_base
    Previously read as COL1 sequential uint32 — completely wrong

### Build 159 — Fix preview not updating on model click (3 compounding bugs)
- Compact list read selection from hidden detail table → empty
- Model index read from col 1 (version string) not col 0 (model index)
- Thumbnail spin set DecorationRole on text cell (no longer a pixmap)
- Fix: unified `_select_model_by_row(row)` for both list handlers

### Build 158 — Remove 200-model hard cap in COL loader
- Hardcoded `if model_count >= 200: break` in col_workshop_loader.py
- generics.col has 1146 models — 946 were silently truncated

### Build 157 — Fix Type vs Version columns (were identical)
- Type = fourcc decoded: COLL / COL2 / COL3 / COL4
- Version = game target: GTA III/VC / SA PS2 / SA PC/Xbox / SA (unused)

### Build 156 — Detail table: SVG icons on non-zero counts
- Spheres/Boxes/Vertices/Faces show 14px SVG icon when count > 0
- Built once per populate from SVGIconFactory, theme-colour aware

### Build 155 — Detail table: 8 proper columns, no thumbnail
- Columns: Model Name, Type, Version, Size, Spheres, Boxes, Vertices, Faces
- Row height 22px, model index in col 0 UserRole

### Build 154 — [=] compact view: COLCompactDelegate
- Custom QStyledItemDelegate draws each row directly
- Name | COL type badge (colour-coded) | 4 inline icon badges
- No thumbnail, single column, 38px row height

### Build 153 — Compact list stats single-row layout
- Name + version left, 4 icon badges right, all on one horizontal row

### Build 152 — Thumbnail right-click: view axis menu
- Both lists: "Thumbnail View" submenu — Top/Front/Side/Iso/Bottom/Back
- _set_thumbnail_view regenerates all thumbs at new angle instantly

### Build 151 — Fix model selection: unified _select_model_by_row
- Both _on_compact_col_selected and _on_collision_selected delegate to it
- Accesses models[] by row index directly, no table dependency

### Build 150 — Debug build (box/sphere counts on select)

### Build 149 — Fix COL Workshop startup crash
- preview_widget not yet created when icon panel connects buttons
- Fix: lambdas so lookup happens at click time

### Build 148 — COL viewport: proper box/sphere/bounds rendering + render modes
- Boxes: 8 corners projected, 12 AABB edges (was invisible 2D rect)
- Spheres: 3 projected rings, 48-segment polylines each
- Bounds AABB: dashed purple, bounding sphere: dotted purple
- Grid extent includes all geometry types
- Render modes: Wireframe/Semi/Solid — V key, right-click, switch btn
- Left nav buttons all wired: flip, rotate, copy, delete, duplicate, create

### Build 147 — Full COL mesh editing
- Click-to-select in viewport (point-in-triangle + 8px vert radius)
- Ctrl+click multi-select, _proj_cache for hit-testing
- Keyboard: Del, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+D
- Flip Face(s): swap B↔C reverses winding
- Select Connected: BFS flood-fill along shared verts
- Merge Close Vertices: weld + remap + remove degenerate faces

### Build 146 — Thumbnail view axis: right-click menu on both lists

### Build 145 — Full COL editing: boxes/spheres/bounds + gizmo fixes
- Gizmo translate/rotate moves ALL geometry
- Mesh Editor: 4 tabs — Mesh, Boxes, Spheres, Bounds
- Recalculate Bounds from geometry button

### Build 144 — ChangeLog v29


## March 2026 — COL Mesh Editor, 3D viewport, gizmo system

### Build 143 — COL3DViewport fully self-contained
- `paintEvent` now draws everything directly using `self._yaw/pitch/zoom/pan`
- No dependency on `_find_workshop()` or `_paint_model_onto` — removes silent
  failure mode where the workshop reference was missing and the view appeared frozen
- Draws grid, mesh, boxes, spheres, gizmo, HUD all in one method
- Right-drag / middle-drag = rotate, left-drag = pan, scroll = zoom now reliable

### Build 142 — Middle mouse rotates scene
- Middle-drag: pan → rotate (matches right-drag)
- Left-drag remains pan only

### Build 141 — Fix zoom not affecting mesh
- `_paint_model_onto` was calling `_draw_col_model()` which recomputes its own
  `scale` from bounds, ignoring `_zoom` — mesh was fixed-size while grid/gizmo zoomed
- Fix: geometry now drawn inline via `to_screen()` (includes zoom + pan)

### Build 140 — Fix COL viewport: full 3D interaction
- Root cause of locked view: `_draw_col_model` used `_project_model_2d` which
  computed its own origin ignoring pan/zoom — grid and geometry in different spaces
- `COL3DViewport` v2 rewritten as fully self-contained:
  `_proj(x,y,z)`, `_get_scale_origin()`, `_to_screen()` — no workshop dependency
- Right-drag: free rotate (yaw + pitch), scroll: zoom, left/middle: pan
- `_paint_model_onto` v4 uses `vp._get_scale_origin()/_proj()` when available

### Build 139 — World-space gizmo at model centre, translate + rotate modes
- Gizmo moved from bottom-left corner to model centroid in 3D world space
- Translate mode (G key): coloured arrows along X/Y/Z, drag to move vertices
- Rotate mode (R key): projected ellipse rings, drag to spin vertices around axis
- Toggle button top-right of viewport, right-click menu, G/R keyboard shortcuts
- Depth-sorted axes (nearer axis draws on top)

### Build 138 — XYZ gizmo + reference grid
- Reference grid: XY plane (Z=0), auto-sized to model extent, behind geometry
- XYZ gizmo (bottom-left corner): red X, green Y, blue Z arrows with arrowheads
- Both in `_paint_model_onto` and `COLMeshEditorViewport`

### Build 137 — COL Mesh Editor with full undo
- New file: `apps/components/Col_Editor/col_mesh_editor.py`
- `COLMeshEditorViewport`: mini 2D preview with selection highlight
- `COLMeshEditor` dialog: face table, vertex table, add/delete/move operations
- Add face: set A/B/C vertex indices + surface material (71 GTA materials)
- Delete face(s): multi-select; delete vertex: remaps face indices automatically
- Remove orphan vertices; local 50-step undo stack; Apply writes to COLFile
- `_push_undo` / `_undo_last_action` v2 on COLWorkshop (deep-copy model)
- Surface Edit button now opens COLMeshEditor (was "coming soon")

### Build 136 — Fix all missing connected methods across codebase
- Full scan: all 221 files clean, no missing methods, no syntax errors
- `imgfactory.py`: `rebuild_img/fast_rebuild/quick_rebuild/safe_rebuild` delegate
  to `apps/core/rebuild.py`; `rebuild_all_img` placeholder; `toggle_debug_mode`
- `gta_file_editors.py` (`IDEFileEditor`): `reload_file/save_file/find_text` real
  implementations; 6 pass stubs
- `Map_Workshop.py` (`MainGUI`): 64 pass stubs for TXD-style methods
- `gui_layout_custom.py`, `gui_menu.py`, `tear_off.py`, `app_settings_system.py`,
  `gui_template.py`: stubs added


## March 2026 — COL Workshop viewport, panel collapse, TXD button layout

### Build 135 — COL Workshop: compact list as default view
- Middle panel now starts in compact thumbnail view (was detail table)
- `_col_view_mode` initialised to `'detail'`, compact list visible, detail table hidden
- `open_col_file` populates both lists on load; selects first row in active view
- `[T]` / `[=]` button toggles between views as before

### Build 134 — COL viewport middle-mouse pan + thumbnail spin + compact settings
- COL3DViewport: middle-mouse drag pans the view on any axis (same as left-drag)
- Thumbnail spin: selecting a model with geometry starts a 20fps QTimer
  rotating its list thumbnail on a random slow axis (yaw 0.8–1.4°/frame,
  pitch rocks ±35°, stops for bounds-only models)
- IMG Factory Settings → Interface tab v2: compact 2–3 items per row
  (H+V spacing on one row; font+size+bold+italic on one row;
  tab height+width on row 1, style+content+position on row 2)

### Build 133 — Fix COL Workshop preview rendering
- COL3DViewport.paintEvent called `_paint_model_onto` which didn't exist
- Added `_paint_model_onto` to COLWorkshop: applies zoom/pan via painter
  transform, filters geometry by visibility flags, draws HUD in screen space
- `preview_widget._workshop_ref = self` set at creation — direct reference
  instead of unreliable parent-chain walk when docked in IMG Factory
- QSlider and Qt added to imgfactory_ui_settings imports (settings crash fix)

### Build 132 — Fix IMG Factory settings dialog crash
- `QSlider` and `Qt` missing from imgfactory_ui_settings.py imports

### Build 131 — Fix TXD Workshop missing method aliases
- 14 aliases + 4 stubs for methods connected but never defined
  (copy/delete/duplicate/paste_texture, export variants, undo, save-as, refresh)

### Build 130 — COL Workshop: restore clean panel methods, proper show/hide collapse
- Restored `_create_transform_icon_panel/text_panel/_create_right_panel`
  from Build 116 (were broken by earlier refactoring)
- Bottom panel: build both text-row and icon-row at startup, show/hide on resize
  (no more `_create_merged_icons_line` / `_rebuild_bottom_panel` that crashed)
- Side panels: `_transform_icon_panel_ref` stored, starts hidden; text panel visible
- `_update_transform_text_panel_visibility` v2: reads threshold from settings,
  toggles all four containers (side icon, side text, bottom text, bottom icon)

### Build 129 — Panel collapse threshold settings slider + both workshops
- IMG Factory Settings → Interface tab: Workshop Panel Collapse group
  with slider 200–900px (default 550), saved to `panel_collapse_threshold`
- `get_collapse_threshold(main_window)` helper in imgfactory_ui_settings
- Both TXD and COL workshops read threshold from settings
- TXD: collapsing also triggers `_update_all_buttons()` for bottom buttons
- COL: bottom buttons rebuilt as icon row when narrow

### Build 128 — TXD panel collapse threshold 550px
- Text panel only shows when right panel ≥ 550px (was 230px — too tight)
- Preview gets ~90% of space in normal use

### Build 127 — TXD Workshop buttons: centred text, icon-only collapse
- Button text centred (removed left-align override)
- Text panel widened to 170px; collapse threshold 230px
- Visibility method v3: measures `_right_panel_ref.width()` directly

### Build 126 — Fix filter_icon in SVGIconFactory
- `filter_icon` used `_svg_to_icon` (doesn't exist); changed to `_create_icon`

### Build 125 — Add filter_icon to SVGIconFactory
- New `filter_icon` (sliders/EQ icon) for Filters button in TXD text panel

### Build 124 — Fix COL Workshop load crash (QWidget viewport)
- COL3DViewport was still the old QLabel version — replaced with QWidget
  implementing zoom_in/zoom_out/fit_to_window/pan/paintEvent/wheelEvent

### Build 123 — TXD Workshop text panel: icon+text buttons, auto-swap
- Text panel buttons gain icons (left-aligned); never shown simultaneously
  with icon strip — threshold 550px drives which panel is visible
- _create_transform_text_panel v13

### Build 122 — Roll back TXD Workshop to Build 73 + safe splitter collapse
- TXD panels were broken by Build 120; restored to last known-good state
- Re-applied only: splitter ref, splitterMoved signal, collapse methods

### Build 121 — Fix COL Workshop load crash (missing method aliases)
- 25 aliases + 10 stubs for methods connected but never implemented
  (_saveall_file, _save_col_file, _open_col_file, export variants, etc.)

### Build 120 — TXD+COL auto-collapse text panel on splitter drag
- `self._main_splitter` stored; `splitterMoved` connected
- `_on_splitter_moved` → `_update_transform_text_panel_visibility`
- Collapses text panel when right panel < 600px

### Build 119 — COL Workshop: rotate/flip views, proper viewport, all buttons wired
- COL3DViewport replaced with QWidget + paintEvent (zoom/pan/rotate)
- Left-drag=pan, right-drag=free rotate, wheel=zoom, context menu presets
- `_create_transform_icon_panel` v13: all buttons wired at creation
- Bottom panel text+icon buttons connected
- Resize behaviour: text panel hides when workshop width < 700px

### Build 118 — COL Workshop: rotate/flip buttons + lazy thumbnails
- Rotate CW/CCW cycles through XY/XZ/YZ projection planes
- Flip H/V mirror the view
- `_populate_collision_list` v5: >100 models use placeholder thumbnails,
  render on first selection


## March 2026 — COL Workshop rendering, parser RE, routing fixes

### Build 116 — COL Workshop: fix thumbnail/preview renderer + COL routing
- `col_workshop.py`: renderer now supports both `COLVertex.x/y/z` (col_workshop_classes)
  and `COLVertex.position.x` (col_core_classes) — was always hitting AttributeError
- Face drawing: support `a/b/c` fields as well as `vertex_indices` tuple on COLFace
- Box/sphere drawing: dual-attribute support for both class hierarchies
- `open.py` `_load_col_file` v5: all COL open paths now call `open_col_workshop()`
  so `.col` files always open with the full Workshop UI, not a blank table tab

### Build 115 — Fix COL open showing blank tab
- Unified file dialog and `open_col_workshop_docked` now call `open_col_workshop()`
  instead of `_load_col_file_in_new_tab()` — full Workshop UI always shown

### Build 114 — Fix double COL tab + "Send to Col Workshop" context menu
- `_load_col_file_in_new_tab` v4: parse COL first, create exactly ONE tab
- Tab right-click → "Send to Col Workshop" for COL tabs
- Deduplicates: switches to existing workshop tab if already open

### Build 113 — COL parser fully verified against special.col + CollEditor2 RE
- `parse_model` v3: correct interleaved layout
  (n_sph→spheres→n_box→boxes→n_fg→facegroups→n_vert→verts→n_face→faces)
- `parse_spheres` v3: 20 bytes all versions (center+radius+surface+piece+pad)
- `parse_faces` COL1: 16 bytes (uint32 x3 + mat + light + pad)
- Fix Vector3/COLMaterial import; fix COLSphere construction
- All 5 models in special.col parse correctly
- `docs/ref_db/col_format_analysis.md`: complete verified COL1 struct layout

### Build 112 — COL Workshop: use _populate_collision_list + real thumbnails
- `open_col_file` calls `_populate_collision_list()` (with thumbnails)
- Compact list `[T]` view also uses `_generate_collision_thumbnail()`

### Build 111 — COL Workshop: implement thumbnail + preview renderer
- `_generate_collision_thumbnail()`: 64×64 QPainter top-down projection
- `_render_collision_preview()`: full-size render with legend
- `_draw_col_model()`: shared renderer (mesh=green, boxes=yellow, spheres=cyan)
- `COL3DViewport` replaced with working 2D QLabel preview
- `VIEWPORT_AVAILABLE = True`


## March 16, 2026 (3) — PS2/LCS/VCS/iOS formats, COL Workshop integration, theme dialogs

### Build 62 — RW Reference dialog: theme-aware code boxes
**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout_custom.py

Colour variables now read from the app theme dict (`_tc`) first, with QPalette only as
last-resort fallback. `<code>` and `<pre>` boxes use `panel_filter` (e.g. `#ffe7e5`)
instead of `QPalette.AlternateBase` which returned dark system colours on custom themes.
Table `<td>` backgrounds use `bg_primary`, even rows use `panel_entries`, headers use
`button_normal`. Added `c_code` variable specifically for inline code boxes. Fonts
improved to Segoe UI/Arial. `apply_dialog_theme()` applied to the dialog frame.

---

### Build 61 — theme_utils.py v2: real theme colour keys
**New/Updated**: apps/core/theme_utils.py

Replaced `_dark_defaults()` (hardcoded `#1e1e1e` etc.) with `_default_colors()` using
the same keys as `app_settings_system.get_theme_colors()`: `bg_primary`, `panel_entries`,
`panel_filter`, `button_normal/hover/pressed`, `table_row_even/odd`, `selection_background`,
`text_primary` etc. `panel_entries` used for list/tree backgrounds, `panel_filter` for
input/filter backgrounds. Dark background in ScanDialog and themed dialogs eliminated.

---

### Build 60 — custom File menu parity + theme-aware dialogs
**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_menu_custom.py, apps/core/scan_img.py, apps/core/theme_utils.py,
apps/core/create.py, apps/core/img_merger.py, apps/core/img_split.py,
apps/core/rebuild_all.py, apps/core/extract.py, apps/core/gui_search.py

Custom hamburger menu (frameless/custom UI mode) was missing "Open COL in COL Workshop"
(`Ctrl+Shift+L`). Added with matching shortcut — both menu systems now have identical
File menu entries.

`apps/core/theme_utils.py` created as shared module with `get_theme_colors(widget)`,
`build_dialog_stylesheet(colors)`, and `apply_dialog_theme(dialog)`. Walks widget parent
chain to find `app_settings.get_theme_colors()`. `apply_dialog_theme(self)` added to:
`ScanResultsDialog`, `RecentScansDialog`, `NewIMGDialog`, `IMGMergeDialog`, `SplitDialog`,
`BatchRebuildDialog`, `ExtractDialog`, `ASearchDialog`.

---

### Build 59 — COL Workshop open integration
**Updated**: apps/components/Col_Editor/col_workshop.py, apps/gui/gui_layout.py,
apps/gui/gui_menu.py, apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py,
apps/components/Img_Factory/depends/comprehensive.py

Four ways to open a COL file in COL Workshop:

1. **Filelist right-click → "Open in COL Workshop"** — now extracts the actual entry
   bytes from the IMG to a temp file and opens directly (was ignoring the clicked row
   and using dir tree priority).
2. **File menu → "Open COL in COL Workshop..."** `Ctrl+Shift+L` — new item in both
   standard and custom File menus, opens a file dialog for standalone `.col` files.
3. **COL Workshop toolbar → "From IMG" button** — new button that shows a picker dialog
   listing all `.col` entries in the currently loaded IMG; double-click to load.
4. **Col Edit toolbar / taskbar COL button** — `edit_col_file` Priority 2 now extracts
   entry data to temp file instead of passing just the IMG path (browse mode).

Collision list right-click context menu — three TODO stubs implemented:
- **Rename Model** — `QInputDialog`, updates table, marks file modified
- **Export Model as COL** — saves single model as standalone `.col`
- **Replace with COL file** — loads external `.col`, picks model if multiple, swaps in

---

### Build 58 — iOS LCS/VCS LVZ support
**Updated**: apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py, apps/methods/img_core_classes.py

iOS LVZ uses a completely different two-level DLRW tree vs PS2:
- Outer cells at 0x28: `[L1_blob_offset(4), float_LOD(4)]`
- Level-1 DLRW blocks per grid cell with sub_record_count
- L2 records (0x20 bytes): geometry ptr, sector_count, img_byte_offset, `0x57524C44` sentinel
- 8412 stream entries extracted from `commer.lvz`

`open_ios_lvz()` added. `_open_ps2()` now tries iOS parser first (strict DLRW sentinel),
falls back to PS2 parser. `VERSION_IOS_LVZ = 45` added.

No GAME.DTZ on iOS — uses standard `gta3.dir` + `gta3.img` (VERSION_1, already works).

---

### Build 58b — iOS disc layout, game_trees reference directory
**New**: apps/core/lcs_vcs_disc_layout.py (iOS_LCS entry), apps/game_trees/

`iOS_LCS` added to `DISC_LAYOUTS`: no DTZ, streaming in `Models/`, textures as individual
`.pvr` files in `Textures_PVR/`. `apps/game_trees/` created with:
- `ios_lcs_texture_mapping.csv` — 4549 PVR→TXD name mappings
- `tree_ios_lcs.txt` — full iOS LCS file tree
- `TODO_txd_workshop.md` — TXD Workshop iOS texture features TODO

---

### Build 57 — LCS/VCS disc layout reference
**New**: apps/core/lcs_vcs_disc_layout.py

Disc layout reference for LCS and VCS PS2 with helper functions:
- `find_disc_root(path)` — walks up from any file to find disc root and game type
- `find_game_dtz(disc_root, game)` — locates GAME.DTZ
- `find_cutscene_img(disc_root, game)` — finds CUTS.DIR+IMG (LCS) or MOCAPPS2 (VCS)

Key structural differences encoded:
- VCS: `GAME.DTZ` at disc root; streaming areas in root; `PS2/MOCAPPS2.DIR+IMG`; `.XTX` textures
- LCS: `CHK/PS2/GAME.DTZ`; streaming areas in `MODELS/`; `ANIM/CUTS.DIR+IMG`; `.CHK` textures

`CHK` added to `FileType` enum for LCS PS2 texture format. `_build_mocap_dir()` updated
to find correct companion file per game. `open_dtz()` uses `find_disc_root()` for LCS/VCS detection.

---

### Build 56 — GAME.DTZ v4: all four name sources working
**Updated**: apps/core/img_dtz.py, apps/methods/img_core_classes.py,
apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py

All four name sources now read directly from the decompressed GAME.DTZ blob:

1. **MDL** — `CBaseModelInfo.m_hashname` (CRC32) resolved via `lcs_vcs_names.py`
2. **TEX** — `CPool<TexListDef>.m_entries[i].m_name` (plain ASCII) at `texListPool` `blob[0x60]`
3. **COL** — `CPool<ColDef>.m_entries[i].m_name` at `colPool` `blob[0x68]`
4. **ANIM** — `CAnimBlock.m_name` array at `blob[0x323DD0]`, 48 bytes/entry, 90 streaming blocks

Source column (col 9) added — visible only for LVZ/DTZ versions, shows companion IMG file
and sector/byte offset. LVZ entries: `AREA.IMG @ 0xOFFSET`. DTZ entries: `GTA3PS2.IMG @ sector N`.

---

### Builds 41–55 — PS2/LCS/VCS format research and UI fixes

**Summary** (see session 5 transcript for full detail):

**UI fixes (Builds 41–45):**
- DAT button `_open_dat_browser` passes correct `target=widget`
- IMG tabs: `QTabWidget > QTabBar::tab` selector fixes tab styling
- DAT bleed-through: `WA_OpaquePaintEvent` removed, `setAutoFillBackground(True)` added
- Per-tool taskbar context menus: DAT/Dir (Show/Close), TXD (Open/Save/Close),
  COL (Open in COL Workshop/Save/Close)
- Filelist right-click: `.col` → "Open in COL Workshop"; `.txd` → "Open in TXD Workshop"

**PS2/LCS/VCS format research (Builds 46–55):**
- `GAME.DTZ`: zlib-compressed blob, magic `GTAG`, contains streaming directory for all models/textures/col/anim
- `apps/core/img_dtz.py` v3: GAME.DTZ parser; 1580 entries (654 mdl + 823 xtx + 16 col2 + 87 anim)
- `apps/core/lcs_vcs_names.py`: CRC32→name lookup, 3658 LCS + 4033 VCS entries from g3DTZ v2.1 (MIT)
- LVZ streaming structure: outer DLRW cells → nested DLRW → `IMG @ sector` offsets; scan stops at `0xAAAAAAAA`; 46 real cells in UNDERG.LVZ
- `VERSION_DTZ_VCS = 46`, `VERSION_DTZ_LCS = 47`, `VERSION_IRX = 48`, `FileType.STRM`
- Build 48: streaming IMG detection — `BEACH.IMG` falsely detected as PS2_V1; companion `.lvz` check added
- Build 49: MALL/COMMER fallback also checks for `.lvz` companion
- Build 50: `open_lvz` IMG byte offset fixed (was storing nested DLRW blob offset, not `DLRW[0x18]`)
- Build 52: scan-based cell parsing (count field was slot count not cell count); stops at `0xAAAAAAAA`
- Build 54: stale `cell_count` variable fixed; `_find_companion` handles `GTA3PS2.IMG ↔ GTA3.DIR` cross-stem
- Build 55: `.strm` extension for LVZ stream entries; `STRM` added to `FileType`


## March 16, 2026 (2) — DLRW parser rewrite, tab status bar, LVZ chain fix

### open_lvz v2 — correct DLRW binary layout

**Updated**: apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py v10

Previous `open_lvz` read `entry_count` from offset 0x14 (= 3128 for BEACH)
then immediately iterated 3128 * 8 bytes from 0x28 reading random data as
entries — producing rows like "bin_3928 = 2,096,776 MB".

**Correct DLRW layout (researched from BEACH/MALL/MAINLA.LVZ):**
```
[0x00]  "DLRW" magic
[0x04]  0 reserved
[0x08]  total decompressed size
[0x0C]  index table offset  (= end of entry header area)
[0x10]  index table offset  (duplicate)
[0x14]  entry_count         (number of streaming cells)
[0x18]  0 padding
[0x1C]  0 padding
[0x20]  header record: data_area_start(4) + nested_dlrw_area_start(4)
[0x28 + i*8]  cell i: sub_entry_count(4) + nested_dlrw_byte_offset(4)
[index_table] entry_count × 4-byte back-pointers
```

Each cell points to a nested DLRW containing audio/visual stream chunks.
MALL.LVZ now parses to 918 cells, BEACH.LVZ to 3127 cells.

`open_lvz` now returns correct `cell_NNNN` entries with:
- `offset`: byte offset of nested DLRW within decompressed blob
- `size`: approximate byte size (next_cell_offset − this_cell_offset)
- `sub_count`: number of stream chunks within the nested DLRW

---

### LVZ open resolves .img → .lvz companion path

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py

When `VERSION_PS2_LVZ` is opened and `file_path` ends in `.img`, the code now
calls `_find_companion(file_path, '.lvz')` to locate the real archive.
Previously it called `open_lvz(self.file_path)` on the `.IMG` file which
decompresses to nothing useful.

---

### Status bar updates correctly after tab switch

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py `_on_tab_changed` v9

`update_img_status` and `selection_status_widget.update_selection` are now
deferred via `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` so they run *after* Qt has finished
processing the table population. Previously the status update fired before
the table rows were committed, reading a stale entry count.

IMG branch also skips `_populate_real_img_table` if the table already has
rows (first-visit-only population), preventing redundant reloads on every
tab switch.

TXD Workshop status update also deferred the same way.


---

## March 16, 2026 — Bug fixes: MALL.IMG detection, TXD Workshop, taskbar icons, status bar

### MALL.IMG (VCS PS2 LVZ) now detects correctly

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py, apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py

**Problem**: MALL.IMG (all-zeros header) fell through to VERSION_1 fallback instead
of VERSION_PS2_LVZ, causing a failed load.

**Root cause 1**: `detect_lvz` used escaped string literals `b'\x78\xda'` which
were being matched as literal text rather than byte values. Fixed to use
`magic[0] == 0x78 and magic[1] in (0xDA, 0x9C, 0x01)`.

**Root cause 2**: `detect_version` never checked for a `.LVZ` companion file before
the standalone V1 fallback. Added `_find_companion(path, '.lvz')` check before
the final size-based V1/V1.5 decision — if a valid LVZ companion exists the file
is detected as VERSION_PS2_LVZ.

---

### TXD Workshop opens without requiring a selection

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py `edit_txd_file` v6

New priority order:
1. Dir tree .txd selection → open that file
2. IMG table .txd entry highlighted → open workshop with that file
3. **No selection** → open workshop in browse mode against current IMG
4. No IMG loaded → open workshop empty (was: "No TXD file selected" error)

---

### Taskbar icons visible at startup

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py

`refresh_icons(icon_color)` is now called immediately after `_create_toolbar()`
at startup, using `text_primary` from the active theme. Fixes black-on-dark
invisible icons caused by the hardcoded `"#000000"` default colour that was
baked in during toolbar construction.

---

### Status bar updates correctly on tab switch

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py `_on_tab_changed` v8,
apps/gui/status_bar.py `update_img_status` v2

**Fixes:**
- `update_img_status` now called *after* `_populate_real_img_table` so entry
  count is accurate (was called before, getting a stale zero)
- Selection count widget (`"N of M selected"`) updated in every branch of
  `_on_tab_changed` (IMG, COL, TXD workshop, empty tab)
- COL branch also resets selection to 0/0 on switch
- Empty/unknown tab branch resets both status bar and selection count

### Status bar version labels expanded

**Updated**: apps/gui/status_bar.py

`_vmap` in `IMGStatusWidget.update_img_status` now covers all 18 `VERSION_`
enum values with human-readable names, e.g.:
- VERSION_PS2_LVZ → "PS2 LVZ/DLRW"
- VERSION_XBOX → "Xbox (LZO)"
- VERSION_SA_ANDROID → "Android SA"

Previously only V1, V1.5, V2, SOL were named; everything else showed the raw
enum name.

## March 16, 2026 — VCS PC format research, XTX texture decoder, LVZ/DLRW analysis

### XTX Texture Format — Fully Decoded

**New file**: apps/methods/xtx_reader.py  
**Updated**: apps/components/Txd_Editor/txd_workshop.py

VCS PS2/PC splash screen textures (.XTX) researched from binary analysis of
actual VCS PC files (LOADSC*.XTX, SPLASH*.XTX, SCEE*.XTX, MEMCARD.XTX).

**Format discovered:**
- Magic: `"xet\x00"` (bytes 0x78 0x65 0x74 0x00)
- Header: 1228 bytes total
- CLUT (256-entry RGBA palette): at offset 0xCC (204)
- Pixel data (1 byte/pixel, palette-indexed): at offset 0x4CC (1228)
- Dimensions derived from formula: `file_size = width × height + 1228`
  - 512×512 → 263,372 bytes (LOADSC*, SCEE* logos)
  - 512×256 → 132,300 bytes (MEMCARD, SPLASH1)
  - 256×256 → 66,764 bytes (SPLASH2–10)
- Pixel format field [20:24] = 7 (PS2 PSMT8 — 8-bit indexed)
- 0xCC fill padding (PS2 SDK uninitialised memory marker)
- Alpha: PS2 range 0–128, scale ×2 for standard 0–255
- No pixel tile-swizzle (linear row-major)
- Colour order: RGBA (standard)

**TXD Workshop changes:**
- Open file filter now includes `*.xtx`
- `.xtx` files routed to `_open_xtx_file()` before TXD parser
- `_open_xtx_file()`: reads XTX, decodes to QImage, shows in workshop
- `_display_xtx_texture()`: populates texture list item, preview, info labels
- Title bar shows: `[XTX — VCS PS2 Palettized 512×512]`

**xtx_reader.py exports:**
- `is_xtx(path)` — magic check
- `read_xtx(path)` → dict with clut, pixels, rgba_data, width, height
- `xtx_dimensions(file_size)` → (width, height)
- `xtx_to_qimage(path)` → QImage (RGBA8888)
- `xtx_to_qpixmap(path, max_size)` → scaled QPixmap

---

### VCS PC Streaming Format Research

Analysed BEACH.IMG, MAINLA.IMG, MALL.IMG and their companion .LVZ files.

**BEACH/MAINLA/MALL.IMG:**
- Custom VCS PC streaming format, magic 0x54 at offset 0
- NOT a standard GTA IMG — does not contain a readable directory
- Companion .LVZ is the compressed index

**BEACH/MAINLA/MALL.LVZ:**
- zlib-compressed (0x78DA deflate header)
- Decompresses to DLRW format
- DLRW structure: `magic(4) "DLRW"` + 8-byte (offset, size) entry pairs
- Offsets point within the decompressed blob itself
- The blob IS the streaming data; the .IMG contains bulk asset data
- Beach: 5.1 MB decompressed → 219 MB .IMG (44× larger)
- STATUS: Read-only detection added; full DLRW index parsing TODO

**VCS_FILES_OF_INTEREST:**
- `.IRX` = PS2 IOP processor MIPS ELF modules (system files, not GTA archives)
- `IOPRP300.IMG` = PS2 IOP kernel replacement image (NOT a GTA IMG)

---

### RW Version Labels Added

apps/methods/rw_versions.py:
- `0x35002000` → `"3.5.0.2 (VCS PS2/PSP)"`
- `0x35001000` → `"3.5.0.1 (LCS PS2/PSP)"`


---

## March 15, 2026 (final) — RW Reference rewrite, ChangeLog v22

### RW Reference Dialog — Complete Rewrite (v3)

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout_custom.py `_show_rw_reference` #vers 3

Expanded from 5 tabs to 7 tabs, replacing sparse placeholder content with
exhaustive human-readable documentation of every format researched during
IMG Factory development. All content is theme-aware (QPalette colours, no
hardcoded hex values).

**New tabs:**
- **IMG Formats** — binary layouts for every supported format with byte offsets,
  field names, and "how we derived this" annotations (e.g. the GTA3 PS2 hex dump
  analysis that revealed the 12-byte PS2_V1 format)
- **RW Versions** — all three encoding styles (plain-int / packed 0xFFFF /
  non-standard), full version table, RW chunk header layout, how version
  scanning works in IMG Factory (multi-offset probe at +0/+4/+8)
- **TXD / Textures** — RwTexDictionary structure tree, D3D9 native header offsets,
  platform IDs (PS2=4, Xbox=5, iOS/PVRTC=8, Android/ETC1=9), mobile TXD notes
- **COL Collision** — COLL/COL2/COL3/COL4 magic bytes, COL1 header layout, SA
  extension summary, COL Workshop notes
- **DAT / IDE / IPL** — section keywords for IDE (objs/tobj/cars/peds/txdp/2dfx)
  and IPL (inst/cull/zone/pick/path), key .dat files, DAT Browser integration
- **Platform Matrix** — full table of all 18 VERSION_ enums with container type,
  sector size, entry format, and current support status; disambiguation table for
  PS2_V1 vs Bully vs PS2_VCS; false-positive case studies; rebuild logic diagrams
- **Troubleshooting** — "file opens as wrong format", "RW version shows Unknown",
  "export produces wrong content", "rebuild makes file larger", LCS iOS streaming
  segments, Ctrl+Up/Down reordering, IMG Factory component version matrix


---

## March 15, 2026 (evening) — RW version display, move entries, detection fixes

### RW Version Column Fixed

**Updated**: apps/methods/rw_versions.py, apps/methods/populate_img_table.py,
apps/methods/img_core_classes.py

**Problem**: TXD/DFF files from Bully PS2 showed "Unknown" in the RW Version column.

**Root causes (3):**

1. `is_valid_rw_version()` v5 didn't recognise `0x1C02000A` (Bully) or PS2 plain-int
   versions (`0x310` etc). Fixed in v6: adds Bully entries, PS2 plain-ints, and a
   fallback that checks `get_rw_version_name()` — so any future named version
   automatically validates without updating this function.

2. `_is_valid_rw_version()` in `img_core_classes.py` was a local duplicate that also
   missed Bully. Fixed to delegate to the canonical `rw_versions.is_valid_rw_version()`.

3. `get_rw_version_light()` v5 only read from `entry._cached_data` (often empty for
   lazy-loaded entries). Fixed in v6: when no cached data, reads the first 16 bytes
   directly from the IMG file (resolving `.dir` → `.img` via `_find_companion`).

### Move Entries Up / Down

**New**: `_move_entries()`, `_move_entries_up()`, `_move_entries_down()` in
apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py

**Keyboard**: `Ctrl+Up` / `Ctrl+Down` in the file list window.

**Context menu**: Right-click → "Move Up" / "Move Down" (appears when entries selected).

Moves selected entries one position in `img_file.entries` list, refreshes the table,
and restores the selection on the new positions. Aborts silently if any selected row
would go out of bounds. Multi-selection moves all selected rows together.

### Bully PS2 Format — open_bully v2

**Updated**: apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py v8

`open_bully()` updated with correct format understanding:
- Bully WORLD.IMG / GTA3.IMG: standard V1 DIR+IMG pair — handled by `_open_version_1`
- CUTS.IMG: count[4] + N*64-byte name-only entries (no offsets) — handled here
- Added sanity check on count (1–10000), data_start approximation, and note about
  HXD block scanning needed for accurate sizes.

## March 15, 2026 (late) — PS2 format deep-dive, case-sensitivity fix, Bully analysis

### Critical Fix: Case-Sensitive .dir/.img Extension on Linux

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py

Root cause of GTA3 PS2 (LC) showing garbage entries: opening `GTA3.IMG` directly on
Linux checked for `GTA3.dir` (lowercase) which doesn't exist — the companion is `GTA3.DIR`.
`os.path.exists()` is case-sensitive on Linux. The check failed silently, fell through
all format checks, and `detect_ps2_v1` matched the raw TXD data at offset 0 as a PS2_V1
directory — producing 938 garbage "entries" with Korean/binary decoded names.

**Fix**: Added `_find_companion(base_path, ext)` helper that tries lowercase, uppercase,
then does a case-insensitive directory scan as last resort. Applied to every `.dir`/`.img`
companion lookup throughout `img_core_classes.py`, `img_shared_operations.py`, and
`rebuild.py`.

---

### Bully PS2 Format (WORLD.IMG / GTA3.IMG)

**Analysis of actual Bully PS2 binary** (WORLD.DIR + WORLD.IMG, 275 MB):

Bully Canis Canem Edit PS2 uses **standard V1 DIR+IMG format** — identical to GTA3/VC PC:
- `.DIR`: 32-byte entries (`offset[4] size[4] name[24]`)
- `.IMG`: 2048-byte sectors, data starts at sector 0
- 10,680 entries (WORLD.IMG), named `ASY_Building.txd`, `ASY_Lobby.dff` etc.
- RW version: `0x1C02000A` (Bully-specific, added to rw_versions.py)

Previous `VERSION_BULLY` (value 44) was based on incorrect format assumptions
(64-byte name-only entries with no offsets). The actual files load correctly as
`VERSION_1` once `_find_companion` handles the uppercase `.DIR` extension on Linux.

`rw_versions.py` updated with Bully entries:
- `0x1C02000A` → `"3.7.0.2-Bully (PS2/PC)"`
- `0x1C020085` → `"3.7.0.2-Bully variant"`

---

### PS2 Detection Fixes (continued from previous entries)

`detect_ps2_v1` v3 — confirmed working on actual GTA3 PS2 (LC) files:
- Rejects files that have a `.DIR` companion (handled by `_find_companion` → VERSION_1)
- Correctly handles standalone PS2_V1 files (12-byte entries, no count header)

`detect_bully` v2 — Bully files don't need special detection:
- Bully WORLD.IMG has a `.DIR` companion → detected as VERSION_1 (correct)
- `VERSION_BULLY` / `open_bully` retained for CUTS.IMG variant (different format)

---

### Outstanding PS2 Work

- LCS PS2 / VCS PS2: `detect_ps2_vcs` logic to be verified with actual files
- `VERSION_BULLY` open_bully: may need revision if CUTS.IMG format differs from assumptions

## March 15, 2026 (evening) — Export fix, Rebuild rewrite, PS2 detection fixes

### Export Bug Fixed — entries exported individually

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_export_entry.py v3, apps/methods/img_export_functions.py v2

**Bug**: Exporting 7 selected entries produced 7 files but with wrong content — all reading
from `img_archive.file_path` directly. For DIR+IMG pairs (V1) this opened the `.dir` file
and read raw directory bytes as entry data.

**Fix**: `export_entry()` now calls `img_archive.read_entry_data(entry)` which correctly
resolves `.dir` → `.img` path, handles Xbox LZO decompression, and covers all format variants.

**Fix**: `_get_selected_img_entries()` now uses `get_active_table()` (active tab's table,
not the shared `gui_layout.table`) and maps by entry name instead of row index, so sorting
and filtering don't cause row/index mismatches.

---

### Rebuild Size Growth Fixed — V1 DIR+IMG now rebuilt as pair

**Updated**: apps/core/rebuild.py, apps/methods/img_shared_operations.py

**Bug**: Rebuilding a V1 (DIR+IMG pair) file grew from 104 MB → 312 MB. The rebuild wrote
header + directory + all entry data into a single temp file then replaced the `.dir` file
with it. The `.dir` became a full IMG file (116 MB) while the original `.img` was untouched.

**Fix**: `_perform_native_rebuild` now detects V1/V1.5/SOL formats and routes to
`_rebuild_v1_pair()` which:
1. Writes all entry data sequentially into a `.img` temp file, recording each entry's
   sector offset as it goes
2. Writes a proper `.dir` temp file (32 bytes × N entries, offsets from step 1)
3. Atomically replaces both `.dir` and `.img` files

V2/V3 single-file formats use `_rebuild_single_file()` which writes data first then seeks
back to fill in the directory with correct offsets (no more placeholder pass).

`get_entry_data_safely()` also fixed — now calls `read_entry_data()` first, then falls back
to a corrected direct read that resolves `.dir` → `.img` path.

---

### PS2 IMG Detection Fixes (continued)

**Updated**: apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py v7

`detect_ps2_v1` v3 — complete rewrite based on actual format understanding:
- Format has NO count header — entries start at byte 0 (sec_off / asset_id / sec_sz)
- Entry count derived from `first_entry.sec_off * 512 / 12`
- Removed `0x16` from RW type rejection list (22 = valid sector offset)
- Cross-validates: asset_id high byte must not be printable ASCII (rules out Bully names)

`detect_bully` v2 — requires first byte of name field (byte 4) to be printable ASCII with
4+ consecutive printable chars; rejects non-ASCII first bytes that PS2_V1 asset_ids produce.

`open_ps2_v1` — removed erroneous `dir_data = dir_data[4:]` offset shift; now correctly
skips null/zero-size padding entries.

---


---

## March 15, 2026 — IMG Format Audit, Folder Scanner, Layout Fixes

### IMG Format Audit — New Version Enums and Detection

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py

Added missing `IMGVersion` enum values covering all known GTA platforms:

- `VERSION_XBOX = 50` — GTA3/VC Xbox, DIR+IMG pair with LZO-compressed entries
- `VERSION_SA_ANDROID = 51` — GTA SA Android, VER2 header + mobile texture DB
- `VERSION_LCS_ANDROID = 52` — LCS Android, VER2 header with 0x1005FFFF TXDs embedded
- `VERSION_LCS_IOS = 53` — LCS iOS, 12-byte entries, 512-byte sectors, `*_pvr.img`
- `VERSION_STREAMING_SEG = 60` — Raw streaming segment (LCS/VCS iOS/PSP), no internal directory

**`detect_version()` v5** — new detection paths:
- `.dir` files: Xbox LZO magic probed before falling back to V1/V1.5
- VER2 files: LCS Android detected by filename (`lcs`/`liberty`); SA Android by mobile DB sibling files (`texdb.dat`, `texdb.toc`, `streaming.dat`)
- `*_pvr.img` files: LCS iOS distinguished from GTA3/VC iOS by filename
- Standalone `.img` with no header and sibling `gta3.img` (VER2) → `VERSION_STREAMING_SEG`

**`detect_img_platform()` v3** — content-based probes:
1. Xbox LZO magic in first entry (95% confidence)
2. Mobile texture DB files alongside (Android, 90% confidence)
3. `*_pvr` suffix → iOS (85% confidence)
4. Filename keywords as fallback

**`open()` dispatch** — new branches for all new versions:
- `VERSION_XBOX` → `_open_xbox()` (reuses V1 dir parser, tags entries as LZO)
- `VERSION_SA_ANDROID` → `_open_version_2()` (same as PC SA, correct sector size)
- `VERSION_LCS_ANDROID` → `_open_lcs()` (VER2 path)
- `VERSION_LCS_IOS` → `_open_lcs()` (12-byte PS2_V1 path)
- `VERSION_STREAMING_SEG` → sets `_streaming_segment_error`, returns `False`

**New methods**:
- `_open_xbox()` v1 — reuses `_open_version_1()`, sets platform=XBOX, marks entries as LZO
- `_open_lcs()` v1 — VER2 for Android, PS2_V1 12-byte for iOS
- `read_entry_data()` v3 — correctly resolves `.img` from `.dir` for all DIR+IMG variants (V1, V1.5, SOL, Xbox)

**Removed**: 368-line duplicate block (second `IMGEntry` class + duplicate `_scan_rw_version`, `detect_img_platform`, `detect_img_platform_inline`, `get_platform_specific_specs`). Python was running the old broken v1 versions of everything because last-definition-wins.

**Added**: `detect_lcs_android()` in `apps/core/img_ps2_vcs.py` — probes VER2 files for 0x1005FFFF TXD entries

---

### LCS iOS Streaming Segment Handling

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py

`indust.img`, `suburb.img`, `underg.img`, `commer.img` in LCS iOS `Models/` are **raw streaming segment files** — they contain asset data but have no internal directory. The directory for all segments lives in `gta3.img`. These files cannot be opened as standalone archives.

- Previously: generic "Failed to open IMG file: VERSION_1" error
- Now: clear message — _"X.img is a streaming segment file. Open gta3.img from the same folder instead."_
- `VERSION_STREAMING_SEG` detected when: no magic header, no `.dir`, but sibling `gta3.img` (VER2) exists in same directory

`gta3.img` itself opens correctly as VER2 — the ~497,000 entries are real (LCS streams the whole game from one master archive split across segment files).

---

### Recursive IMG Folder Scanner

**New file**: apps/core/scan_img.py

**File → Scan Folder for IMGs…** (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) — recursively scans any folder for IMG-compatible files.

- Background `ScanThread` walks entire tree, results appear live as found
- Shows: Name, Version (V1/V2/Xbox/SA Android/LCS iOS/etc.), Platform, Size, Path
- Subtle background tint per version family for at-a-glance identification
- Filter bar — narrow by name, version, or platform as you type
- Platform dropdown — PC / Xbox / PS2 / Android / iOS / PSP
- Select by Platform button
- Double-click or **Open Selected** to open files in new tabs
- Warns before opening more than 10 files at once
- `ScanResultsDialog` and `ScanThread` exported for reuse

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_menu.py — `MenuAction("scan_img_folder", ...)` added to File menu

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py — `scan_img_folder()` method wired to menu

---

### Hybrid Load + Scan Folder added to toolbar and Settings

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py `_get_img_buttons_data()` v4

- **Hybrid Load** button added to IMG Files toolbar panel
- **Scan Folder** button added to IMG Files toolbar panel
- Both added to `_create_method_mappings()` so they fire correctly

**Updated**: apps/utils/app_settings_system.py `_create_buttons_tab()`

- Hybrid Load and Scan Folder added to **Settings → Buttons → IMG Files Buttons** colour editor

---

### Settings Colors Tab Layout Fix

**Updated**: apps/utils/app_settings_system.py  
**Updated**: App-Settings-System repo (github.com/X-Seti/App-Settings-System)

Three bugs fixed in the Colors tab:

1. **Colour list not stretching** — `right_layout.addWidget(scroll_area)` had no stretch factor. Changed to `addWidget(scroll_area, 1)` so the colour list expands when the window grows; sliders and action buttons stay at natural height.

2. **`QHBoxLayout(self)` corrupting dialog layout** — `theme_layout = QHBoxLayout(self)` passed the dialog as parent, silently replacing its top-level layout. Changed to `QHBoxLayout()`.

3. **Left panel not resizable** — replaced the `QHBoxLayout` containing left/right panels with a `QSplitter(Horizontal)`. Left panel has `min=220, max=400`, right panel gets `setStretchFactor(1, 1)`. User can now drag the divider.

---

## March 10, 2026 (evening) — Hybrid Load, COL column, DAT Browser xref improvements

### Hybrid Load

**Added**: File → **Hybrid Load (IMG + COL)...** `Ctrl+Shift+H`

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py
- `open_hybrid_load()` v2: opens an IMG file and automatically pairs every DFF entry with its matching COL data before the table renders. COL sources checked in priority order:
  1. COL entries **inside the IMG itself** (GTA III / VC / SA world props)
  2. **Sibling `.col` file** in the same directory (e.g. `game_sa.col` next to `game_sa.img`, `game_vc.col` next to `game_vc.img`)
  3. **`models/coll/`** external category archives for SA/SOL (`vehicles.col`, `peds.col`, `weapons.col`) — sub-model names read directly from COL binary headers
- Game type detected from DAT Browser / `game_root`; SA/SOL external scan only runs when appropriate
- Log summary e.g. `Hybrid Load: game_sa.img  |  2734 DFF entries  |  2190 paired  |  544 no COL  |  312 sibling COL sub-models`
- Pairs stored in `self._pending_hybrid_pairs` before async thread starts; consumed in `_on_img_loaded()` once table is actually populated (fixes timing bug where column was filled before table existed)
- `_on_img_loaded()` v5: checks `_pending_hybrid_pairs` after `_populate_img_table_widget()`; calls `populate_col_column()`, logs match count, clears pending data

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_menu.py
- `MenuAction("hybrid_load", "Hybrid &Load (IMG + COL)...", "Ctrl+Shift+H")` added to File menu after Open Multiple

### COL column (column 8)

**Updated**: apps/methods/populate_img_table.py
- `setup_table_for_img_data()` v4: column count → 9; added **COL** header at index 8; `setColumnHidden(8, True)` — invisible on normal open, revealed only by hybrid load; resize mode set for all 9 columns
- `populate_table_with_img_data()`: same 9-column setup with COL hidden by default
- **Added `populate_col_column(table, paired)`** v1: iterates all rows; for DFF rows looks up stem in paired list — `✓ stem (source)` in green if matched, `✗ missing` in red if not; non-DFF rows left blank; calls `setColumnHidden(8, False)` to reveal column; sortable so missing entries can be grouped by clicking header

### DAT Browser / xref improvements

**Updated**: apps/methods/gta_dat_parser.py
- `build_xref()` v2: accepts optional `game_root`; for SA/SOL also scans `models/coll/` COL archives and indexes sub-model name stems into `col_stems` — tooltips now correctly show `has col` for vehicle/ped/weapon DFFs whose collision lives in an external archive rather than inside the IMG

**Updated**: apps/components/Dat_Browser/dat_browser.py
- `_on_load_done()`: passes `_thread.game_root` to `build_xref()` so SA/SOL external COL scan runs automatically on DAT load

---

## March 10, 2026 — DAT Browser enhancements, Dir Tree improvements, click-drag multi-select

### DAT Browser

**Updated**: apps/components/Dat_Browser/dat_browser.py
- `_game_combo` v2: added **"Game Root (Dir Tree)"** entry (index 5); combo width increased to 155 px
- `_on_game_combo_changed()` v1: new slot wired to `currentIndexChanged` — selecting "Game Root (Dir Tree)" immediately reads `directory_tree.current_path` (falls back to `main_window.game_root`), fills the path field, detects the game, switches the combo to the detected game entry, and calls `_start_load()` automatically — no Browse or Load click required
- `_start_load()` v4: cleaned up (removed dead index-5 block now handled by `_on_game_combo_changed`)
- `_auto_fill_game_root()` v1: silently pre-fills path and game combo from dir tree on every open/re-open; only fires if path field is currently empty (never overwrites a manually set path)
- `show_dat_browser()` v2: calls `_auto_fill_game_root` on show and on tab re-add
- `integrate_dat_browser()` v4: calls `_auto_fill_game_root` after widget creation
- `_make_table()` v3: switched base class to `DragSelectTableWidget`; added `ExtendedSelection` — all three tables (Objects, Instances, Zones) now support click-drag row selection
- Responsive toolbar v2: `Browse…` / `Load` buttons collapse to 32×32 icon-only squares below 520 px width; icons loaded lazily on first compact transition (folder icon / go-arrow icon); no fixed widths in full mode — Qt sizes naturally
- Load-order tree right-click context menu: **Edit** (opens text editor) for `.ide .ipl .dat .txt .cfg .ini`; **Open in IDE Editor** for `.ide`; **Copy path** for all entries
- `_setup_tree_context_menu()` v1, `_on_tree_context_menu()` v1, `_open_path_in_editor()` v1, `_open_in_ide_editor()` v1

**Updated**: apps/methods/gta_dat_parser.py
- `GTAWorldXRef.tooltip_for()` v2: richer hover bubble — `"Model defined in: vehicles.ide"`, `"Type: Vehicle"`, `"TXD: landstal.txd"`, optional `"COL: landstal.col  [present]"`; TXD-only files list up to 5 model names that share the TXD; COL files confirm COLFILE directive presence

**Updated**: apps/methods/populate_img_table.py
- `apply_xref_tooltips()` v2: sets tooltip on **all columns** of each matching row (not just Name column) so the info bubble appears wherever the cursor lands on the row
- **Added `DragSelectTableWidget`** v1: `QTableWidget` subclass implementing click-hold-drag row selection via `mousePressEvent` / `mouseMoveEvent` / `mouseReleaseEvent` overrides; `DragEnabled=False`, `NoDragDrop`, `ExtendedSelection`, `SelectRows` set by default; Shift+Click and Ctrl+Click still work normally; exported in `__all__`

### Dir Tree

**Updated**: apps/components/File_Editor/directory_tree_browser.py
- `populate_tree_recursive()`: permissions column now shows **`755  rwxr-xr-x`** (octal + symbolic) for both files and folders via new `_perms_str(mode)` inner helper
- `show_context_menu()` v3: **Edit** action for `.ide .ipl .dat .txt .cfg .ini .zon .cut .fxt` files (opens `IMGFactoryTextEditor`); **Open in IDE Editor** action for `.ide` files
- `_edit_text_file()` v1, `_open_ide_editor()` v1: delegate to `notepad.open_text_file_in_editor` and `ide_editor.open_ide_editor`

### IMG Factory file window / IDE Editor buttons

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py
- `edit_ipl_file` mapping: wired to `_open_selected_text_file('.ipl')` (was `_log_missing_method`)
- `_open_selected_text_file()` v1: opens currently selected file from dir tree if it is a text-editable type; falls back to QFileDialog filtered by extension
- `_get_dir_tree_selected_file()` v1: returns currently selected file path from dir tree widget or `_dir_tree_selected_file` attr
- `_open_file_in_text_editor()` v1, `_open_file_in_ide_editor()` v1: helpers for dir-list context menu
- `_on_directory_list_context_menu()` v2: **Edit** and **Open in IDE Editor** actions for `.ide .ipl .dat .txt .cfg .ini .zon .cut .fxt` in the directory file list; COL Workshop action preserved
- Main table: switched to `DragSelectTableWidget` (was plain `QTableWidget`)

### Click-drag multi-select (all tables)

**Added**: apps/methods/populate_img_table.py — `DragSelectTableWidget` (see above)

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- `IMGEntriesTable` v2: now inherits `DragSelectTableWidget` instead of `QTableWidget`; redundant `setSelectionBehavior/Mode` calls removed (set by base class)

**Updated**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py
- `_create_initial_tab()`: tab tables now use `DragSelectTableWidget`

**Updated**: apps/methods/dragdrop_functions.py
- `setup_table_entry_drag()` v2: **removed `setDragEnabled(True)` and `DragDrop` mode** — these were stealing the left-button gesture away from row selection and showing a `+` drag cursor on first click; drag-out logic preserved as `table._explicit_start_drag()` (callable from right-click menu); drop-in (files → import) still works via `acceptDrops=True`

**Updated**: apps/core/right_click_actions.py
- Added **"Drag to Desktop / Folder…"** action under Extract Selected; calls `table._explicit_start_drag()` if present

---

## March 09, 2026 — RW button icon/visibility, SIGSEGV fix, stylesheet bug fix

**Updated**: apps/methods/imgfactory_svg_icons.py
- `SVGIconFactory.rw_scan_icon()`: magnifying glass with "RW" label inside lens; themed via `_create_icon`

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py
- `rw_scan_btn`: now uses `rw_scan_icon()` SVG — no more blank button
- `refresh_icons()` v2: updates rw_scan_btn icon on theme change
- `_update_rw_btn_visibility()` v1: shows button only when active tab is IMG; connected to `main_tab_widget.currentChanged`
- `_apply_status_window_theme_styling()`: fixed `color: #{text_primary}` → `color: {text_primary}` (was emitting `##hex`, causing stylesheet parse error)

**Updated**: apps/methods/column_width_manager.py
- `setup_column_width_tracking()`: guard `new_size > 0` on sectionResized; `setSectionsMovable(False)` now set here — column drag-reorder disabled (was causing SIGSEGV when signal fired mid-move on C++ Qt object)

---


## March 09, 2026 — RW Version Scan dialog implemented in activity bar

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout_custom.py
- `_show_rw_scan_dialog()` fully implemented (was a stub wired to a button but had no body)
- Shows table of all DFF/TXD entries: Name, Type, RW Hex, RW Version name
- Summary counts by version at top (e.g. `3.1.0: 120  |  Unknown: 12`)
- Unknown entries shown in dimmed placeholder-text colour
- **Force Rescan All** button: resets cached rw_version on every DFF/TXD entry, re-runs detect_file_type_and_version() from disk, refreshes column 5 of active table without full reload
- All colours from QPalette (theme-aware)

---

## March 09, 2026 — RW Scan button: forced rescan + version frequency dialog

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py
- `RW` button added to activity log header (24×24, sits left of the log button)
- `_show_rw_scan_dialog()`: QPalette-themed dialog showing:
  - File name, format version, total entries, DFF/TXD count, detected count, unknown count
  - Version frequency table — RW version string, count, % of DFF/TXD; unknown rows highlighted orange
  - **Rescan RW Versions**: re-reads first 128 bytes of every DFF/TXD entry from disk and probes every 4-byte-aligned offset 0..64 (wider net than the original 8/12/16 probe)
  - **Reload Table**: repopulates the active IMG table widget with updated `entry.rw_version` data after a rescan
  - Progress bar during rescan; status label shows scanned/updated counts
- `_rescan_rw_versions(img_file, progress_cb)`: standalone method; handles `.dir`→`.img` path redirect; returns `(scanned, updated)` counts

---

## March 09, 2026 — VERSION_1_IOS: separate iOS detection, fix _read_header_data for V1 family

**Updated**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- `IMGVersion.VERSION_1_IOS = 47` — dedicated enum for iOS GTA3/VC (`*_pvr.img`); same 12-byte/512-byte-sector format as `VERSION_PS2_V1` but kept separate so iOS files are never conflated with Android or PS2 files
- Removed `VERSION_1_MOBILE = 46` — this was architecturally wrong (iOS files do not use a companion `.dir`; they are self-contained with embedded 12-byte entries, same as `VERSION_PS2_V1`)
- Removed `_probe_dir_sector_size()` — no longer needed; restored `_detect_v1_or_v1_5()` to its original simple form
- Detection in `detect_version()`: before `detect_ps2_v1()` check, test if filename contains `_pvr` → assign `VERSION_1_IOS`; otherwise `VERSION_PS2_V1` (Android/PS2)
- `_open_ps2()`: `VERSION_1_IOS` now routes to `open_ps2_v1()` alongside `VERSION_PS2_V1`
- Open dispatch: `VERSION_1_IOS` added to PS2 block; removed from V1 block
- `_read_header_data()` v2: V1-family (VERSION_1, VERSION_1_5, VERSION_SOL) opened via `.dir` path now correctly redirects to companion `.img`; uses `endswith('.dir')` check instead of unconditional `.replace('.dir', '.img')` which could corrupt paths that don't end in `.dir`

---

## March 09, 2026 — iOS/Android GTA3/VC: V1_MOBILE detection (512-byte sectors)

**Fixed**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- `IMGVersion.VERSION_1_MOBILE = 46` — new enum for .dir+.img pairs using 512-byte sectors (iOS/Android GTA3 and VC ports)
- `_probe_dir_sector_size(dir_path, img_path)` — new helper: reads first 32 .dir entries, computes max byte address at both 2048 and 512 sectors, returns 512 if 2048-sector layout overshoots the .img file size but 512-sector layout fits
- `_detect_v1_or_v1_5()` v2: calls `_probe_dir_sector_size` before name inspection; returns `'V1_MOBILE'` when 512-byte sectors detected
- `detect_version()` v5: maps `'V1_MOBILE'` result to `IMGVersion.VERSION_1_MOBILE` in both the .dir entry path and the .img-with-companion-.dir path
- `_open_version_1()` v6: reads `sector_size = 512` when `version == VERSION_1_MOBILE`, otherwise `2048`; all entry `offset` and `size` calculations use the probed sector size
- Open dispatch: `VERSION_1_MOBILE` added to the V1/V1.5/SOL routing block

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout_custom.py — format reference dialog
- iOS/Android table: GTA III and VC rows updated to show `.dir+.img pair, 512-byte sectors (V1_MOBILE)`; SA row retains VER2/2048; LCS still under investigation
- Sector addressing table: added explicit row for `iOS / Android GTA3/VC (.dir+.img) → 512 bytes, detected automatically as V1_MOBILE`
- Status tab: replaced `Version 2 — GTA III/VC iOS/Android` rows with `Version 1 Mobile — GTA III/VC iOS/Android (512-byte sectors)` — read ✓, write ✗ (read-only)

---

## March 08, 2026 — Format Reference: iOS platform docs, palette-based colours

**Updated**: apps/gui/gui_layout_custom.py — `_show_rw_reference` v3
- **IMG Archive tab**: added iOS/Android platform table covering all War Drum Studios ports (GTA III Dec 2011, VC Dec 2012, SA Dec 2013 — all confirmed loading OK; LCS Jun 2015 — fails, under investigation); VCS noted as never released on iOS/Android (PSP/PS2 only); sector size table updated to distinguish PC/iOS/Android (2048 B) from PS2/PSP (512 B)
- **Status tab**: IMG archive section expanded with individual rows for GTA III iOS/Android ✓, VC iOS/Android ✓, SA iOS/Android ✓, LCS iOS/Android ~ (investigating); VCS never-released note added
- **All colour values**: replaced every hardcoded hex fallback with live `QPalette` role lookups (`Base`, `AlternateBase`, `Text`, `PlaceholderText`, `Highlight`, `Mid`, `Button`, `ButtonText`, `Link`, `LinkVisited`) — dialog renders correctly on any Qt theme (light, dark, system, custom)
- About dialog labels: replaced `color: #666` / `color: #888` with `color: palette(placeholder-text)` — no hardcoded hex anywhere in gui_layout_custom.py

---

  - **RW Versions tab**: all three encoding formats (plain 0x300–0x3FF, old compact 0x30000–0x3FFFF, packed 0xFFFF low-word); full version table with platform annotations; validation rules including Xbox offset scan and 0-byte guard
  - **Section Types tab**: all RW section IDs (0x0001–0x001F + Criterion plugin extensions 0x0253F2xx); header layout (type/size/version at offsets 0/4/8)
  - **TXD Format tab**: TXD container structure; tex_count differences (GTA III/VC uint32 vs SA uint16+device_id); Texture Native struct field-by-field platform comparison; pixel format detection priority order; data_size field presence rules per platform
  - **Platforms / Xbox tab**: full Xbox compression byte map (0x00/0x0B/0x0C/0x0E/0x0F/0x10/0x11); Xbox name corruption explanation and known-extension whitelist; platform_id table; PS2 vs PC differences
  - **IMG Archive tab**: V1 (GTA III/VC), V2 (SA), V1.5 (extended) formats with field layouts; sector addressing rules (2048-byte sectors); special entry display rules (Empty, Unknown)
  - **Status tab**: complete read/write support matrix for all texture formats, RW version ranges, and IMG archive versions
- Toolbar: `rw_ref_btn` added immediately after `settings_btn` — "RW Ref" with info icon and tooltip

**Added**: apps/methods/rw_versions.py (commits 5e0a45b → 2ae2999)
- `0x00000300` = "3.0.0 (GTA3 PC early)" — plain integer, earliest builds

- `is_valid_rw_version` v5: plain-integer range widened from single 0x310 special case to full 0x300–0x3FF range, covering all GTA III PC pre-packed versions

**Added**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- `_is_valid_rw_version` v2: mirrors rw_versions change — 0x300–0x3FF range replacing 0x310 single check

---

**Previous session commits (March 08, 2026 — earlier):**

commit 4f384de — Xbox IMG RW version detection
- `_scan_rw_version()` module-level helper: scans bytes at offsets 8/12/16 for valid RW version; handles standard and Xbox-prefixed header layouts
- `_is_valid_rw_version()` module-level helper in img_core_classes.py
- `_detect_rw_version()` / `detect_rw_version()` on IMGEntry use scanner
- `detect_rw_version_from_data()` in rw_detection.py scans multiple offsets
- `get_rw_version_light()` in populate_img_table.py validates before accepting
- `is_valid_rw_version()` in rw_versions.py: range extended to include 0x1400FFFF (Xbox)
- `0x1400FFFF` = "3.4.0.0 (GTA III/VC Xbox)" added to name table

commit a8d40e6 — V1 DIR name corruption (split-on-null)
- `rstrip(b'\x00')` → `split(b'\x00')[0]` at all four name-decode sites

commit 3d889c7 — V1 DIR name corruption (known-extension whitelist)
- `_KNOWN_GTA_EXTENSIONS` set and `_parse_entry_name()` module-level helper
- Stops at first null, finds last dot, checks chars after against known extension set; handles non-null garbage bytes like 0x77 0x78 after extension
- Fallback: keep only `[A-Za-z0-9_\-@+.]` chars
- Applied to all four name-decode sites; `detect_file_type_and_version` re-sanitizes via `_parse_entry_name`

commit 5e0a45b — Early GTA3 RW versions
- `0x00000310` = "3.1.0 (GTA3 PC)" — plain integer, not packed
- `0x0401FFFF` = "2.0.0.1 (GTA3 early TXD)" — packed but below old 0x0800FFFF lower bound
- `is_valid_rw_version` v4: uses `(v & 0xFFFF) == 0xFFFF AND 0x0400 <= (v >> 16) <= 0x1C03` discriminator for packed format; explicit special cases for 0x310 and 0x1C020037

commit 6fd5e3a — 0-byte entry display
- `get_rw_version_light()` v5: DFF/TXD entries with size==0 return "Empty"
- `get_rw_address_light()` v3: same 0-byte guard
- `get_version_text()` v3 on IMGEntry: same 0-byte guard

- _toggle_column v1: toggles visibility across both panels; state persisted per session
- _read_rw_version v1: reads first 12 bytes of DFF/TXD, extracts RW version word at offset 8
- _move_selected_to_parent v1: moves selected items up one directory level; refreshes tree
- populate_tree_recursive v2: fills all 7 columns using os.stat(); Created=ctime, Modified=mtime, Perms=octal mode
- show_context_menu v3: added Move to /parent option under copy/cut section

**Fixed**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py

- _save_settings v2: saves debug_mode, debug_output_terminal/file/activity; re-syncs live img_debugger after save

**Fixed**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py
- startup: calls set_debug_main_window(self) after _restore_settings so debugger is live from launch
- load_file_unified v8: COL branch now routes to _load_col_file_in_new_tab (was calling load_col_file_safely directly causing double tab); removed 51 lines of dead unreachable IMG fallback code after return True

**Fixed**: apps/methods/update_ui_for_loaded_img.py
- update_ui_for_loaded_img v6: added None guard on gui_layout.table before calling setVisible; was crashing with NoneType has no attribute setVisible when COL loaded with no active IMG tab

**Fixed**: apps/gui/gui_menu.py
- _update_recent_files_submenu: two inline QAction imports corrected from PyQt6.QtWidgets to PyQt6.QtGui; was raising ImportError on every recent file update

**Fixed**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- add_entry v4: stamps date_modified on new entries at creation time; all debug prints removed; structure repaired after regex damage

**Fixed**: apps/core/pin_entries.py
- save_pin_file v1: removed debug print loop; silent on error

**Fixed**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py
- load_and_apply_pins v4: removed debug print calls

**Fixed**: apps/core/import_via.py
- _import_log: debug_only path now calls debug_log(main_window, 'import_via', msg) instead of inline settings check

**Fixed**: apps/methods/populate_img_table.py, apps/methods/col_structure_manager.py, apps/methods/col_workshop_loader.py, apps/methods/col_workshop_structures.py, apps/components/Txd_Editor/txd_workshop.py
- Removed all DummyDebugger/DebugFallback/img_debug_logger fallback classes; these printed unconditionally bypassing the debug gate; replaced with direct import of img_debugger from apps.debug.debug_functions


## February 25, 2026 - Date Tracking, Pin File Integrity, Row Colours, Version Detection

**Fixed**: apps/core/rename.py
- rename_img_entry v5: debug logging at each step; active table passed to _populate_real_img_table; rename notify uses settings popup/log flags
- _rename_with_img_archive v4: calls pin_file_sync_rename to update pin file key after rename
- rename_col_model v3: rename notify uses settings popup/log flags
- integrate_rename_functions v3: all 4 rename routes (right-click, toolbar, menu, custom) point to single rename_entry

**Fixed**: apps/core/remove.py
- remove_selected_function v6: pin filter runs before confirm dialog; skipped pins logged/popup per settings
- _remove_entries_with_tracking v3: calls pin_file_sync_remove to delete removed entry keys from pin file
- remove_entries_by_name v4: filters pinned entries during name lookup

**Fixed**: apps/core/undo_system.py

- refresh_after_undo v3: passes active table to _populate_real_img_table

**Fixed**: apps/core/pin_entries.py
- _save_pin_config v2: was writing plain JSON list overwriting v2.0 structure; now loads existing pin data, updates only pinned state, preserves date_modified and all other fields
- _migrate_from_v1 v2: preserves date_modified, source_file, notes when migrating old format entries

**Fixed**: apps/core/right_click_actions.py
- show_context_menu v4: uses get_active_table() instead of hardcoded gui_layout.table; duplicate Remove action removed

**Fixed**: apps/gui/gui_layout.py
- load_and_apply_pins v3: restores date_modified from pin file to all entries on load; date cell updated in table

**Fixed**: apps/gui/status_bar.py

**Fixed**: apps/methods/tab_system.py
- refresh_current_tab_data v4: uses get_active_table() + _populate_real_img_table instead of shared gui_layout.table + populate_img_table; ensures rebuild refreshes correct tab

**Fixed**: apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py
- _populate_real_img_table v5: row colours applied for new (blue), replaced (red), pinned (amber); import refresh passes active table
- get_entry_rw_version v4: V1 files read from .img not .dir (was seeking directory index instead of file data)
- is_pinned second pass: only sets is_pinned=True when pin_data pinned=True (was pinning any entry present in pin file)
- import loop: case-insensitive name match + fallback to last entry for date stamp

**Fixed**: apps/methods/img_core_classes.py
- IMGVersion enum: VERSION_1_5 = 15 added for extended DIR/IMG (up to 4GB, long filenames)
- _detect_v1_or_v1_5: detects V1.5 by IMG size >2GB or entry name field with no null terminator
- detect_img_version: .dir path now calls _detect_v1_or_v1_5 to distinguish V1 from V1.5

**Added**: apps/utils/app_settings_system.py
- Settings > Interface > Rename Notifications group: popup and log toggles (rename_notify_popup, rename_notify_log)
- Settings > Interface > Pinned Entry Warnings group: popup and log toggles (pin_warn_popup, pin_warn_log)

- icon_map: rebuild-all maps to get_rebuild_all_icon (was document-save)
- icon_map: window-close-all maps to get_close_all_icon
- Button tuples: Close All uses window-close-all, Rebuild All uses rebuild-all
- _set_right_panel_icon_only: buttons 36x36 icon-only when panel narrow (<250px)
- _update_button_display_mode: text-only default, splitter resize triggers icon-only
- create_status_window: f_entries_btn uses safe hasattr lambda (method only in subclass)

**Added**: apps/app_info.py

- delete_selected v4: uses _active_tree so right panel deletions get correct selected items
- _copy_selected_files v2: pushes undo entry after copy
- delete_selected v3→v4: uses send2trash for system trash instead of permanent delete
- Drag/drop wired on both trees via _setup_tree_dragdrop
- Refresh button and context menu refresh both call _refresh_all_panels

**Added**: dragdrop_functions.py
- setup_tree_drag_drop v1: drag from tree, drop onto folder with shutil copy, pushes undo entry

- setup_tree_as_extract_target v2: drop table entries onto dir tree folder to extract them
- Hover highlight on drag_move using theme palette highlight colour at 50% opacity
- drag_leave clears hover, drop clears hover
- Fixed: hasData → hasFormat for QMimeData
- Fixed: import_multiple_files now gets img_archive from current tab before calling
- Desktop drag: entries extracted to temp dir first so OS gets real files not sticky note

- file_window.hide() on dir tree active, show() on file tab active (was hiding main_tab_widget only)

**Fixed**: imgfactory.py
- _on_tab_changed v5: hides file_window entirely when dir tree active, content_splitter 50/50 when file tab open

**Fixed**: tab_system.py
- setup_table_entry_drag wired on every new table widget

- ❌ Tab system is still creating problems, Trying to export entries we get error messages "loaded img file can not be found". ??

### 1. tab_system.py (Version 6)
**Location**: apps/methods/tab_system.py
**Changes**:
- `validate_tab_before_operation` (vers 3) - Now checks tab widget data directly
- `get_current_file_from_active_tab` (vers 2) - Gets data from tab widget, not current_img
- `get_tab_file_data` (vers 4) - Removed fallback to current_img
- `get_current_active_tab_info` (vers 2) - Uses tab widget exclusively

**Key Fix**: Validation now checks the actual tab widget data instead of main_window.current_img

### 2. file_validation.py (Version 1)
**Location**: apps/methods/file_validation.py
**Purpose**: Universal file validation that works with IMG, COL, and TXD files

**Functions**:
- `validate_img_file()` - For IMG-only operations
- `validate_col_file()` - For COL-only operations
- `validate_txd_file()` - For TXD-only operations
- `validate_any_file()` - For operations that work with any file type
- `get_selected_entries_for_operation()` - Validates AND gets selected entries

**Update**: - November 15, 2025
- ✅ Dynamic file type detection
- ✅ Proper error messages per file type
- ✅ Works with tab system automatically
- ✅ No more hardcoded "Current tab does not contain an IMG file"


**Fixed**: - November 14, 2025

### Build 78-95 — DFF Texture List, IDE Cross-Reference, Missing TXD Scanner

**New files**:
- apps/core/dff_texlist.py — RW chunk walker (linear scan), parse_dff_textures, check_txd_in_img, ide_txd_in_img, find_missing_txds
- apps/gui/dff_texlist_dialog.py — DFFTexListDialog, MissingTXDDialog (batch scanner, large-IMG threshold)
- apps/core/img_ide_find.py — find_not_in_ide, find_orphan_txd, find_orphan_col, find_all_col, find_all_dff_in_ide

**Updated**:
- apps/core/right_click_actions.py — show_context_menu v6 (clean layout, SVG icons, submenus per file type); show_dff_texture_list v3 (real parser, IDE xref lookup); _xref_for_img (os.path.commonpath matching)
- apps/components/Dat_Browser/dat_browser.py — project game_root priority over Dir Tree; xref stored per game_root in xref_by_root dict; table updates deferred via QTimer to prevent segfault
- apps/methods/populate_img_table.py — apply_xref_status v2 (Status column updated with In IDE/Not in IDE/Orphan TXD/In COLFILE, detects column by name); IDE Model + IDE TXD hidden columns (cols 9/10 for standard layout); _set_cell guard
- apps/methods/gta_dat_parser.py — xref tagged with game_root
- apps/gui/gui_menu.py — Tools > Find in IDE/COL submenu (5 entries)
- apps/components/Img_Factory/imgfactory.py — column count 9->11 for standard layout, 10->12 for LVZ/DTZ

**Fixes**:
- Segfault from column out-of-bounds access (_set_cell guard, deferred xref apply)
- IDE TXD check was checking texture names not the IDE-declared TXD name
- DAT Browser was using Dir Tree last-browsed path instead of project game_root
- xref game mismatch (VC files showing orphan when SA xref loaded) — os.path.commonpath fix

### Builds 162–196 — TXD Workshop overhaul, COL Workshop fixes, PyInstaller support

**Session**: March–April 2026 (Claude AI pair programming)

---

#### TXD Workshop (txd_workshop.py)

**Parser fixes (Build 163–165, 178–180, 189):**
- COL1 parse order fixed (skip-4 after spheres, before boxes)
- COL2/3 SA: 5 bugs fixed vs DragonFF reference (block_base, flags field, offset order, vertex count, multi-model advance)
- PAL4 nibble order: high nibble = first pixel
- DXT5 alpha: correct 6/4 intermediates
- GTA3/VC palette RGBA vs SA BGRA (`palette_is_bgra` flag)
- PAL8 pixel offset: palette raw + pixel data 4-byte size prefix
- **Build 189**: D3D9 SA textures (platform_id=9) wrongly detected as DXT1 — D3D8 `platform_prop==1/3/5` check now guarded by `platform_id==8`
- **Build 189**: Name/mask fields: `find(b'\x00')` first-null termination instead of `rstrip` — fixes garbled alpha names from garbage bytes

**Navbar buttons (Build 184–188):**
- Flip/Rotate: pure Python pixel loops replaced with PIL `Image.transpose()` (instant vs frozen)
- Thumbnail (col 0) now refreshed after flip/rotate/filters — was only updating text col 1
- `_reload_texture_table` v4: restores row selection after rebuild
- Copy/Paste/Clone/Delete: selection restored after table reload
- `_convert_texture` v3: actual PIL conversion for all 8 formats (was only setting format flag)
- `_edit_main_texture` v2: selects texture in parent workshop, raises window
- Removed duplicate `MipmapManagerWindow` class (428 dead lines)
- `edit_btn` removed from `_update_all_buttons` (local var, not `self.X`)
- **Build 188**: Icon panel buttons never enabling — text panel overwrites `self.X` refs; `_set_transform_buttons_enabled()` now walks `findChildren(QPushButton)` on both panels

**Import button (Build 187):**
- Always enabled (was disabled until TXD loaded)
- Single file + selected texture: Replace/Add/Cancel dialog
- Replace: LANCZOS resample to original dims, keep format/name
- `_validate_texture_dimensions` defined (was called but missing → AttributeError on every import)
- New texture dict includes all required fields (mipmap_levels, raster_format_flags, etc.)

---

#### COL Workshop (col_workshop.py)

**Icon panel buttons (Build 190):**
- Same overwrite bug as TXD: `_set_col_buttons_enabled()` walks both panels via `findChildren`
- `surface_type_btn` and `build_from_txd_btn` wired to handlers (both panels)

**Delete/wrapper crash (Build 191):**
- 22 alias wrappers: `(*a, **kw)` → `(*_, **__)`, drop Qt signal args before forwarding
- Qt `clicked` signal passes `bool(checked)` — was forwarded to methods taking only `self` → TypeError + core dump

**Material editor (Build 191–196):**
- Three modes: Apply to Selected Faces / Apply to ALL Faces / Enter Paint Mode
- Shows current face material at top of dialog
- Undo pushed before every paint operation
- Paint toolbar (Build 192–196): replaces yellow HUD text banner
  - Material dropdown with 16×16 colour swatch icons per item
  - 22×22 colour swatch label beside combo (updates live)
  - ↩ Undo button, ✕ Exit Paint button
  - **Build 196**: toolbar is a floating overlay parented to COLWorkshop, positioned via `mapToGlobal` over viewport (fixes Qt layout reflow issue)
  - **Build 196**: 🖌 Paint | 💧 Dropper (pick material, auto-reverts) | ▣ Fill (flood same-material faces) tools

**Right-click face context menu (Build 194):**
- Right-click a face in viewport (normal or paint mode): info header with colour icon, Copy material, Paste material (shows clipboard value), Apply to N selected faces, Clear this face, Clear all faces, Open material editor
- All mutations push undo; right-click on empty space = rotation drag (unchanged)

**Large file support (Build 190):**
- Files >64 MB: `mmap.mmap(ACCESS_READ)` — no 2GB RAM spike
- Progress reporting every 5% + `QApplication.processEvents()`
- >512 MB: confirmation dialog; >32 MB: WaitCursor
- Sanity limits raised: vertices/faces 200k→2M, spheres/boxes 10k→50k

**Stubs implemented (Build 185):**
- `_convert_surface`: version change dialog (COL1/2/3)
- `_build_col_from_txd`: scan TXD → create stub COL models
- `_show/_create/_remove_shadow_mesh`: full shadow mesh management
- `_compress_col`: informative; `_uncompress_col`: reload from disk
- `_show_shaders_dialog`: wireframe/solid/painted preset picker

---

#### PyInstaller support (Build 195)

- `imgfactory.spec` created with `PyQt6.QtNetwork` in hiddenimports (file:// protocol handler), `apps/` and `assets/` in datas, WebEngine excluded (~200MB saving)
- `_qurl_from_path()` wrapper in `dragdrop_functions.py`: `os.path.abspath()` before `QUrl.fromLocalFile()` — fixes "unknown protocol file://" in frozen builds
- 4 call sites in dragdrop_functions, 1 in img_browser replaced

---

**Files changed this session:**
- `apps/components/Txd_Editor/txd_workshop.py`
- `apps/components/Col_Editor/col_workshop.py`
- `apps/methods/col_workshop_loader.py`

- `apps/methods/dragdrop_functions.py`
- `apps/components/Img_Browser/img_browser.py`
- `imgfactory.spec` (new)

#### DFF Parser fix (May 2026)

**Mesh explosion on VC vehicles (dff_parser.py Version 6):**
- RW 0x0C02FFFF morph target layout corrected: bsphere(16)+has_pos(4)+has_nrm(4) header precedes triangle data inside morph target, parser was reading triangles before this 24-byte header giving garbage indices
- Added `_parse_binmesh()` method: EXTENSION chunk (0x03) containing BinMesh plugin (0x050E) was never parsed; BinMesh indices now take precedence over inline triangles when present
- All triangle indices now 100% valid across VC vehicle DFFs (banshee, angel, mule tested)
- Fix applied to all copies: `apps/methods/`, `apps/components/Col_Editor/depends/`, `apps/components/Model_Editor/depends/`

**DFF frame world transform (_DFFGeometryAdapter, model_workshop.py Version 118):**
- `_DFFGeometryAdapter` was using raw local vertex coordinates with no frame transform
- Added `_world_matrix()` static method: walks frame parent chain accumulating rotation matrices and translations
- Each geometry piece (wheels, chassis, extras) now renders at correct world position
- `_display_dff_model` updated to pass `dff_model` and `atomic` to adapter constructor

---

#### COL Workshop sphere fix (May 2026)

**COL1 sphere parsing wrong axis (col_workshop_parser.py Version 9):**
- `parse_spheres` and `parse_spheres_alt` read `center(12) + radius(4)` but COL1 binary stores `radius(4) + center(12)`
- Result was negative/wrong radii and sphere centers displaced by one field width
- Fixed in all 4 copies across Img-Factory-1.6 and Col-Workshop repos
- Verified against vehicles.col binary: all 19 deluxo spheres now have positive radii, centers within vehicle bounds

**Files changed:**
- `apps/methods/dff_parser.py`
- `apps/components/Col_Editor/depends/dff_parser.py`
- `apps/components/Model_Editor/depends/dff_parser.py`
- `apps/components/Model_Editor/model_workshop.py`

- `apps/components/Col_Editor/depends/col_workshop_parser.py`
- `apps/components/Model_Editor/depends/col_workshop_parser.py`


---

#### Path Workshop (May 2026)

**New: apps/components/Path_Workshop/path_workshop.py Version 1**
Three tabs covering all VC/SA text path formats:
- Train Paths — train.dat + train2.dat (x,y,z,speed,flags per waypoint, loop terminator)
- Flight Paths — flight.dat/2/3 (VC dodo AI routes, x,y,z,speed)
- Static Paths — spath0.dat VC text format (x,y,z nodes terminated by END)

PathMapCanvas: 2D overhead view with pan (middle/right drag), zoom (wheel), node drag.
Direction arrows on path lines, fit-all [F], labels toggle, radar background loader.
Waypoint panel: full XYZS field editor, add/del/move-up/move-down.
smart_file_router updated: train*.dat, flight*.dat, spath0.dat → Path Workshop.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/components/Path_Workshop/path_workshop.py` (new)
- `apps/methods/smart_file_router.py`
